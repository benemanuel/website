So you want to be a good parent. Very nice. Do you have any idea what a good parent is ? Have you ever meet someone whom you can take and example of a good parent ? Can you be just like them ?

Are these good parents ? 1. A father who attempted to kill his son. 2. A father who wants to give his entire inheritance to his dysfunctional recluse child and not to his obedient nice natured son. 3. A father whom we see that all his sons are fighting one another even to the point that they want to kill one of the younger ones but in the end "just" sell him off to slavery.

As you already guessed these are our forefathers. These are our examples of good parents. These were people who with all there mistakes, wanted to do what God wanted first.
