As I meticulously organize my upcoming journey, I find myself navigating through the intricacies of planning and decision-making – a series of "if... then... else" scenarios, akin to a complex computer program with numerous control statements.

Yet, amidst this structured approach, a deeper contemplation arises:

- Yes, I acknowledge the importance of planning.
- Yes, I understand the value of preparation.
- However, I recognize a subtle self-deception when I claim to leave room for God in my plans, implying a willingness to let Him guide my path. In truth, it's often my own agenda and designs that take precedence.

This desire to constantly "do" and exert control can inadvertently stifle the spirit within, preventing it from thriving. The insistence on control acts as a constraint, hindering the natural flow of that divine essence.

How, then, can I allow the spirit of God to move freely? The answer lies in relinquishing control and granting freedom to the spontaneous and unscripted movements.

Certainly, I possess the capability to observe and analyze my journey. Planning and understanding the route are essential aspects of the process. However, I must remain attuned to the movement of God, allowing His guidance to be the driving force behind my actions.

It brings to mind the biblical analogy: "For when the cloud arose, the people would travel, and when it rested, the people camped." This metaphor encapsulates the idea that my movements should align with the divine flow, responsive to the subtle cues of God's guidance.

As I reflect on these insights, I offer a simple prayer for all who profess to act in the name of God – may our intentions be pure and untainted, grounded in a genuine devotion to Him. For without purity of heart, our deeds risk becoming self-serving endeavors disguised as acts done in His name.

As I plan and arrange for my trip. I look ahead and work out my ways.

if .. then .. else .. if .. then .. else do

Another computer program with lots of control statements.

But this is what I feel:

yes, you want to plan

yes, you want to be prepared

yes, you are lying to yourself in that you claim to leave places for God in your plans to show you the way. your way your plans, not His.

That wanting to DO pushes aside the spirit and doesn't allow it to live.

that need of control suffocates that part which has to flow.

How will I allow that spirit of God flow? letting go of control. allowing that doing and movement to be free.

Of course I have eyes on my head.

of course I plan to look and attempt to understand the trek.

But the movement of God is that one that is to move me. for it is His movement that I move at all.

Something in the way of: _For when the cloud arose the people will travel and when it sat the people camped_

and with this the simple prayer goes out for all that claim that they are doing thing for God.

Be clean and pure unto Him, before doing. otherwise you are just doing for yourself in the disguise of doing it for him.
