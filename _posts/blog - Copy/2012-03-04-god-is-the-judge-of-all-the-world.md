Although we have heard it already, we thought that the time has yet to come when God will reign over all the earth. So I have new for you. The time has come.

Today I received a notice from the court that there is no judge in Israel.

And when there is no judge in the country, even if we otherwise imagined. we gave ourselves to actual judged by God alone.

It is true that courts called "God" but also they pulled their hands from it.

Welcome to the day. "On that day God will be One and His name one."

And watching to see God's judgment in the world today.
