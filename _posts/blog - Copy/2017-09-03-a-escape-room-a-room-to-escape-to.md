When I think of an escape room I think of a room to escape to.

A room were no electronic or communication devices exist.

A room where lighting and air is natural but no windows which you see out of.

In this room the only food might be a small bottle of water.

It has no bed and one is not to sleep in it.

I have no problem with some paper and pens, but would be hesitant for much more.

Can we survive with ourselves? Can we allow ourselves to escape? For how long?
