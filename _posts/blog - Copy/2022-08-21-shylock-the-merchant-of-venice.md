I enjoyed seeing the [Jerusalem production](https://theaterintherough.co.il/) of Shakespeareâ€™s The Merchant of Venice.

One thing hit me strongly. I know no Jew as this Shylock. But many Antonio and his like.

I know that demand for justice and what is right. I know the yearning for vengeance. But as we all know, no one knows best how to take revenge then God "I will get revenge and pay them back at the time their foot slips; for the day of their disaster is near, and the impending judgment is rushing upon them!" (Deuteronomy 32:35).

The Christians talked high about mercy, but it is only mercy to them. As to the Jew what mercy can there be? His judgment is one of justice and does not have any room for mercy. They judge the Jew, yet this is as they themselves would and do behave.

The Jew no matter how selfish, greedy and materialistic, requested justice. His enemy (Antonio) who looked down on him and never ceased to belittle him, was in need and yet was given the hand of a loan. The enemy in his arrogance thought not of what demands the loan required, _a pound of flesh_. The enemy lost twice (the lowering down to ask for a loan and his loss of ships which didn't allow him to pay it back) and was this enemy willing to be meek? belittle himself? ask for mercy? Was he willing to give mercy? The world claims the Jew (Shylock) would do as they do. But in reality they freely take and overtake. Is it revenge?

O LORD, the God who avenges! O God who avenges, reveal your splendor. Rise up, O judge of the earth. Pay back the proud. (Psalm 94 1-2)
