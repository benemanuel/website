I am the primary obstacle in my life. Without me, everything would work out smoothly. I would consistently make the right decisions, never make mistakes, and most importantly, I wouldn't struggle with doing and pursuing what I truly desire.

Unfortunately, I find myself being a hindrance to my own progress. If it weren't for divine intervention, I'm uncertain how I would handle the challenges I pose to myself.

I am grateful, God, for the awareness you've given me about how I hinder myself from realizing my true self, which ultimately belongs to you.

I've reached a point where I'm fed up with my self-sabotaging tendencies, and I acknowledge that only through your intervention can I break free from this destructive cycle.

original:
If not for me everything would working out. I would always be doing all the right things. I would never be mistaken, and the most important,

I would not bother myself to do and want, **what I really want**.

But in the meantime I'm such a bother to myself that if God did not hold tight I don't know what I would do (to myself).

I am thankfully aware to you God, that you have showed me (a little) how I bother you from allowing myself to realize my true self (which is basically His)

I've had enough of my damned self that messes up my life that only You can release me from it.
