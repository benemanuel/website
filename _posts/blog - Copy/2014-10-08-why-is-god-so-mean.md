Why is it when we are in fear and crying out, yes really crying out with all our heart and soul he does not answer us? Why does he ignore us in our time of need. We do not like when we are in need, to be ignored. We feel desolate and as orphans. Emotions grow are we feel that God doesn't care about us.

Connection with God isn't "only" when we "need him". Connection is always. With a little forethought maybe we can do some preventative measures to those times of "need" or do we prefer closing ourselves off from the simple steps we have to take, and enjoy the results.

Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places; Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town: How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge? Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you. Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand; You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words: So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear; When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you.

Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me: For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord: They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them. So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full. For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction.

But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil. (Proverbs 1 20-31)
