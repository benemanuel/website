How are you dealing with the present situation?

According to the Kübler-Ross model there are five stages of grief:

1\. Denial and isolation

2\. Anger

3\. Bargaining

4\. Depression

5\. Acceptance

Are you still attempting to ignore what’s happening and carrying on as usual? (1. Denial and isolation)

Are you pissed off and full of anger? "It's the damned Chinese's fault who did this!" (2. Anger)

Can I just go out to the beach? Or do some shopping? (3. Bargaining)

I can't live like this, if this continues I'm going to die. (4. Depression)

We are making the best of it, enjoying the quietness and time together to do things which we normally are just to busy to do. (5. Acceptance)

Isn't it easier just to quickly as possible get through the stages and embrace it?
