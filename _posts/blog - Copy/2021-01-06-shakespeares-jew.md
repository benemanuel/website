I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us do we not bleed? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us do we not die? And if you wrong us shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. (The Merchant of Venice, (III.i.49â€“61))

The hurt, disease, joy, vengeance etc. of God's people is not the same as the rest of the world. They use their animal instincts to guide them. They are pulled between emotion and intellect, lost from the Godly drive to be good and righteous. God's created his nation of Israel, a nation with a moral compass which is not just for themselves but for the world around them.
