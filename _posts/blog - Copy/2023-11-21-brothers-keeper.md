Imagine growing up in a community that prided itself on acceptance. In this place, the essence of belonging meant embracing everyone who reciprocated that acceptance. Yet, as I navigated this environment, I realized a fundamental truth: accepting those who actively rejected our existence was inviting trouble and ultimately our destruction.

  
In the tapestry of the society I call home, Israel, inclusion extended to every facet, even those seemingly at odds with each other. The litmus test for acceptance was simple: are you willing to acknowledge and empathize with the existence of others? A poignant moment for me was discussing fallen soldiers, and my stepson, detached, remarked, "I don't know them." It made me ponder deeperâ€”shouldn't empathy extend beyond knowing someone personally?


Being part of a nation isn't just about sharing similarities; it's about feeling and relating to others, even when they appear different. It's recognizing that, despite diverse appearances and perspectives, we're all threads in the same societal fabric. If one can't grasp this understanding or feel that connection, they risk alienating themselves from the very essence of being part of a nation.

I, am my brother's  keeper!
