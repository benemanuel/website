I do not like to engage in politics, but sometimes the fog around is so deep that I feel obligated to return to the source.

Schnitt Committee was established to examine the law of early childhood. Details of the results, and you can see the link

Dear Minister,

Re: Schnitt Committee Report

1\. As we know in God's nature, both parents born in the world.

2\. Natural parent male and female.

3\. Nature that both parents are responsible for the children.

4\. Even if both parents do not live as a couple, from where is that the duty of raising children are not equal?

5\. Any other decision is against the nature of God nature of the world.

6\. Schnitt Committee recommendations as in God's creation, and accept it.

Sincerely and Respectfully
