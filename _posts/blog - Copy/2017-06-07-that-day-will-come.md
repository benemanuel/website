â€¦ until new life is poured out on us from heaven.

**T**hen the desert will become an orchard

and the orchard will be considered a forest.

**J**ustice will settle down in the desert

and fairness will live in the orchard.

**F**airness will produce peace

and result in lasting security.

**M**y people will live in peaceful settlements,

in secure homes,

and in safe, quiet places.

**E**ven if the forest is destroyed

and the city is annihilated,

**Y**ou will be blessed,

you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams,

you who let your ox and donkey graze. (Isaiah 32:15-20)
