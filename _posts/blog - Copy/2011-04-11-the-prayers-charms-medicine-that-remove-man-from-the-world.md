A person feels ill, he must remember that we should please God. No other gods.

"Prayers": that everyone pray for me. Forgetting who to pray to and what to pray. And it's not for our needs but the needs of God.

"Charms (in Hebrew the same word as treasure)": there are plenty, from red strings around the hand, testing mezuzot of the house etc.. Forgetting that “then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine”

"Medicine": If charms are plenty medicine is even more so. Forgetting “for I am the LORD that healeth thee”. I guide you with which medicine, when and how much.

So in going with God to the challenge. Without a 40-day prayers at the Kotel. Without replacing all mezuzahs home. Without Bach flowers, Ricki and so on.

A friend told me about a relative who had the “terrible disease” (a term used for cancer) . They made lots of prayers, all the charms they could find, and any medicine conventional and others that they could find.. And he died. Responses from the family. It’s God's fault we did everything.

And when he was called "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain."

I prefer

Deliver me from blood, O God, Thou God of my salvation; so shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.
