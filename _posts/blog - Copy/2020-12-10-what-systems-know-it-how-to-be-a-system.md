Systems will never tell you to just do what you feel is right, or ask God personally.

Systems don’t know how to work that way.

But how do we work?

We are born and bred into the systems, methodically programmed to work and live as the system desires.

Even to “anti-system’ers” are the outcome of the system.

God tells us that while being a slave to the system, we fall in-love with it, we don’t want to be free, we like that security & family.

But if the servant should declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’ then his master must bring him to the judges, and he will bring him to the door or the doorpost, and his master will pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him forever. (Exodus 21:5-6)

Do we want to server the system or God? Are we willing to not be slaves or man anymore?

God is constantly and consistency checking us to hear him.

You reprimand arrogant people.

Those who stray from your commands are doomed. (Psalms 119:21)

This is what we need to hear today more than ever.

The system has worked hard to get to this place, and mankind needs to be free to be God’s children

The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations;

people yet to be born will praise the Lord. (Psalms 102:19)
