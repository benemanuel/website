We are all humans with flesh and blood, and as such, we have likes, opinions, desires, and personal interests. Perhaps this morning, a spouse angered us, a neighbor yelled, or our food spoiled. In the midst of these everyday challenges, what can we truly expect? Justice, truth, and pure ethics?

Do we live in a utopian existence with angels, or do we reside in the reality of human existence in this world?

Can we claim the ability to judge others when, in reality, we all grapple with emotions like jealousy, anger, revenge, and lust? Despite feeling these emotions, we're inherently human and selfish. When faced with criticism or confrontation, we often experience a sense of humiliation.

One might wonder, does this lead to the conclusion that there is no universal truth in the world; instead, everyone possesses their own truth? If chance aligns us with someone whose truth involves harmful actions, is that acceptable? Is it justifiable that luck led others to be under the influence of someone compassionate towards their crimes and lies?

Yet, in this world, there is a divine force, a unique truth. The Day of Judgment awaits, where all living beings will be judged by this ultimate truth. Regardless of education, views, desires, or any other factors, there exists one divine truth that is right and just for all.

Importantly, the person driven by egoistic desires and personal interests is creating the very judgment that will ultimately encompass them.

We are all of man of flesh and blood and as such he has like, he has opinions, wants, wishes and personal interested. His wife angered him this morning, the neighbor yelled at him, his food was spoiled.

At all what I expect? Justice, truth, pure ethics?

Where I live? In space? With Angels?

Do I have the ability to judge others? After all, they have jealousy, anger, revenge, lust. What do I have? Even if I feel these things. I'm human. I'm selfish. And when I get hit or shouted upon I feel humiliation.

If so maybe we will get to the conclusion that there is no one truth in the world, but everyone has his own truth. So if my lucky brought me to be with one that his truth is to "eat people" then that's fine?!. And it is good that their luck has brought so they fell before such a person who is compassionate toward them with their crimes and their lies.

But there is a God in the world. A unique force with a unique truth. Judgment will be. Day of Judgment comes to all living things are judged by his truth. No matter his education, his views, his desire, etc. there is one divine truth. And it is right and just for all.

The person whom acts with egoistic desire seeking, and personal interests. Create that which will judge but himself.
