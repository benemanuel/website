When you see sadness in someone's eyes, it's likely not stemming from an external lack but rather an internal emptiness. They may wish to believe it's something external, like a need for love and care, providing a momentary relief akin to a short-lived painkiller.

Offering them the salvation of God's great love and mercy for all living beings provides a profound and enduring solution. Sharing the truth that God guides all his children on their path can bring lasting joy and a sparkle to their eyes throughout the day.

However, few are willing to pass on this enduring joy, and it appears even fewer are ready to exchange quick, short-lived painkillers for something as powerful and long-lasting.

Let us celebrate in God's grace and express gratitude for all of his creation.

original:
When see in some ones eyes  sadness, you can be sure that the sadness is not from something that they are missing from there outside. But of something deep inside which is missing. They of cause will prefer to hear that it is something external. A little love and care or such. But this is just a "upper" for the second or so, a type of  pain killer who's effect is short lived.

Give them the rope of salvation, the great love of God and his mercy on all living. Give them the truth that God shows all his children his way. Then you have giving then a joy and twinkle in the eye for day long.

But few and far are willing to pass forward this endless joy. And (so it seems) fewer who are willing to put aside the quick and short lived pain killers for one so powerful and long lasting.

**Let us rejoice in Gods grace and give thankfulness to all of his creation.**
