First the base technical info from

[https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/virus\_differences](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/virus_differences)

Viruses, worms, Trojans, and bots are all part of a class of software called "malware." Malware is short for "malicious software," also known as malicious code or "malcode." It is code or software that is specifically designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other "bad" or illegitimate action on data, hosts, or networks.

So you have a device, you can do so many things with it, but not just you.

You have a rock. Someone takes it from you and kills someone else.

It was your rock…

I don't have a straightforward answer, were does ones responsibility start and end. But God is great, so I asked and received:

_Now all this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements of the royal palace of Babylon. The king uttered these words: "Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence by my own mighty strength and for my majestic honor?" While these words were still on the king’s lips, a voice came down from heaven: "It is hereby announced to you, King Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom has been removed from you! You will be driven from human society, and you will live with the wild animals. You will be fed grass like oxen, and seven periods of time will pass by for you before you understand that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms and gives them to whomever he wishes,”_

_Now in that very moment this pronouncement about Nebuchadnezzar came true. He was driven from human society, he ate grass like oxen, and his body became damp with the dew of the sky, until his hair became long like an eagle’s feathers, and his nails like a bird’s claws. (Daniel 4:25-30)_

King Nebuchadnezzar was not responsible for the outcome of his actions? Did it just "happen"?

Our connected devices (hands, tongue, brain etc..) who can be responsible if not us?

Our other devices we must also protect lest they fall prey to malicious hands.

What can we expect from those who are not into the latest and greatest?

This is not new. And we must relate to the tools accordingly.

_And at the age of fifty years they must retire from performing the work and may no longer work. (Numbers 8:25)_

There is a point which we much accept our abilities/disabilities.

If we see that we don't know how to protect our devices,

Then GET HELP.
