Today, I had a profound encounter with God. One thing I've realized is that these experiences are deeply personal and not easily conveyed to others, whether through words or even on a computer screen.

Life is filled with various experiences, and each person must seek and embrace them on an individual level. Consider the bond between a mother and her daughter – it's challenging to truly understand it without personally experiencing that connection. Similarly, our educational system acknowledges the importance of hands-on learning; students receive stimuli to engage with different aspects of their studies beyond mere theoretical knowledge.

In life, everyone seeks stimuli and experiences, whether it's through adventurous activities like rappelling, experimenting with substances, experiencing religious ecstasy, or engaging in altruism.

If we desire a genuine connection with God, we need to actively seek it. Such an experience is invaluable and holds significance comparable to any other worldly experiences. However, it cannot be forced upon us – we must genuinely yearn for it.

It's an indescribable, awe-inspiring, and remarkable encounter, so much so that words fall short in capturing its essence.

Today I had a special experience with God. The major part of my experience is that experiences with God are personal and not for others. Experiences no matter how well we tell them don't go well on paper (not even a computer)

And there are many experiences in life, everyone must obtain them personally. For what is worth telling the experience of relationship of a mother and her daughter, when the daughter must experience the connection herself. Thus as we see in the school system there are attempts to advocate the learning experience, the student will receive learning stimuli and in such will connect to other facets of studies not only dry frontal learning.

Everyone is one looking for stimuli and experiences in life. If in rappelling or in drugs. If in religious ecstasy or in altruism.

If we want a living experience with God we must ask for it. That experience of God is not worth less than the all the other experiences in the world. But we have to want it for it cannot come compulsively.

Cool, super and great it is, so much so that it is impossible to describe.
