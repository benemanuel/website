It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High; To declare Thy loving kindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness in the night, (Psalms 92,2-3)

I finished writing on how important it is to thank and glorify God. But what good is words if I find myself only saying them but not feeling them enough. Do the world need to hear another person say crap like this? there are enough people in the world. So at least I write and I pray to God to give me a little strength to praise him with all my might at any time and in all cases even if I feel it on hard. Recognize that He is here at all times and at all times keeps us and with him together. Maybe tomorrow I will have the ability to write a few wholeheartedly Thanksgiving, for without that how can I live?

It is better to say the truth then from lying to oneself.
