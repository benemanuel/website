Once again, I find myself in front of the welfare officer, who compiles a report for the judge responsible for determining the nature of my connection with my children in accordance with state laws. Historically, the process involved submitting a written declaration and handwritten approval from their mother to the court secretary at least 48 hours prior to the decision. This protocol was in place even on my son's Bar Mitzvah, and regrettably, it's not a humorous situation.

Dealing with this absurdity feels overwhelming. Up to now, it seems like the walls have better hearing than those involved in these proceedings.

God, I trust in your ability to handle these matters. Grant me the strength, patience, and a secure path to navigate through this challenging situation. You know the lengths I would go for my children, who are ultimately your children. I believe that you are working for me, your beloved son.

Again I stand before the welfare officer who gives a report to the judge who decides how the connection between me and my children will be according to the laws of the state. If this is similar to what was until now, it looked like this: You shall submit a written declaration and a hand written approval of their mother to the courts secretary at least 48 hours before ... then I will decide. So it was on my son's Bar Mitzvah. Unfortunately it's not a joke.

What can I do with all this absurdity? Until now the wall hears better.

God, I know you take care of matters. God just give me the power and patience, and safe being to pass it safely. Because you know what I would do for my children, they are your children. I trust you're doing for me, your beloved son.
