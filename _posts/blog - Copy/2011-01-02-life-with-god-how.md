How does God's presence impact my life, and what changes does it bring to my current state? Should I scrutinize my actions and the motivations behind them, or is it more important to go with the flow? Are my deeds driven by egoistic motives, or do they harbor pure intentions?

When God enters my life, it's akin to the rising sun dispelling fog, revealing the true nature of my intentions. Selfish motives, as well as those of others, become glaringly apparent. No longer can I passively accept nonsense as commandments, charity as mere acts of kindness, or love as genuine.

Just as the ego of others is evident, my own ego becomes glaringly apparent, making it challenging to coexist with myself and others. The key realization is that all forms of ego, even "nice ones", are inherently negative. Only God's revelation in the world, despite trials and judgment, is **truly good**.

God in our lives? What shape will this change what I have now? Is there any reason that I should take notice of why I or others do things? (is it not more important to flow with it) Are our actions are out of egoistic reasons or is there some pure intentions in them?

When God enters our lives it becomes clear as when the sun rises and shines which clears all the fog. And then in the outmost fashion our selfishness intentions and others stand out. Then we can no longer sit quietly and accept all the nonsense as commandments, all charity as an acts of kindness, nor all love as true love.

In the same fashion that stands out the ego of others so does our ego stand out to ourselves. It such a fashion that to live with ourselves becomes unbearable. And even more so with others. The lifesaver comes with the understanding that the ego in all its shapes and fashions (even pretty) is**bad**. And only God's revelation in the world (even with trial and judgment) is **good**.
