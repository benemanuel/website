עִזְב֣וּ פְתָאיִ֣ם וִֽחְי֑וּ וְ֝אִשְׁר֗וּ בְּדֶ֣רֶךְ בִּינָֽה׃ (משלי ט, ו)

Leave unsurely and live (for to live you must decide) , go forth in a way you understand. )Proverbs 9:6(

The answer “I don’t know” isn’t very helpful. (see post [liveliving-diedying](liveliving-diedying))

One has to decide. Otherwise they get “stuck in the mud”.

Just the acceptance of understanding, is a tremendous freedom, and allows that clarity the could now/would not exist without it.
