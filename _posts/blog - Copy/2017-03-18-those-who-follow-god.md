Know my son, that those who follow God, and those who do not, tend to leave a trail to help others see their footsteps.

Those who do not follow God are stringent and extremely careful for they dictate commandments of man, not God. Or even worse so, make commandments of man as if they were of God.

Those who follow God, follow Gods commandments.

There are so many examples of this, may God guide us:

Money & Profiteering

1.You must not lend him your money at interest and you must not sell him food for profit. (Leviticus 25:37)

Days & Time

2.God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.” There was evening, and there was morning, marking the first day. (Genesis 1:5)

Truth & Faithfulness

3.But you will be able to counter the advice of Ahithophel if you go back to the city and say to Absalom, “I will be your servant, O king! Previously I was your father’s servant, and now I will be your servant.”(2 Samuel 15:34)

Solid Belief & Trust

4.You will also know that your children will be numerous,

and your descendants like the grass of the earth.(Job 5:25)

Zionism & Anti-Zionism

5.May all who hate Zion be humiliated and turned back!(Psalm 129:5)
