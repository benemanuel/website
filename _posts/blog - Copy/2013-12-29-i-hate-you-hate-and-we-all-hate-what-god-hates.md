I have my hates (a bit stronger then dislikes)

You have your hates.

There are things that we both hate. Isnâ€™t it great that we think alike? J

But do those things God hate.

Yes that God of peace & love. What does he HATE?

You immediately jump up, God of Love and Peace could hate???

I pray that I, you and everyone else should Love like/who God loves and hate what God hates.

Proverbs 6, 16-19

There are six things which the LORD hates, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:

Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;

A heart that devised wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil;

A false witness that breathes out lies, and he that sowed discord among brethren.
