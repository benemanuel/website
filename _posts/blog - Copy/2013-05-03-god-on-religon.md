God isn't religious, I said. What do you call religion? he quipped. So i quoted from a popular knowledge base encyclopedia - wikipedia: "Religion is an organized collection of belief systems, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to spirituality and, sometimes, to moral values. Many religions have narratives, symbols, traditions and sacred histories that are intended to give meaning to life or to explain the origin of life or the Universe. From their ideas about the cosmos and human nature, they tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle."

And you say God isn't religious? still completely not believing. Didn't you say that you believe that God showed himself to the ancient Hebrew and their prophets? That his words are spoken in the TaNaCh (the Jewish Bible)? Yes I did, and this does not make him religious. Then go explain all those rules and priesthood that are written in the Torah (first books of the Jewish Bible)? That seems a organized collection and system. True it does. But that is not what God wants for us. I'm lost, He wrote it (or gave it to Moses) or not? If he did then he wants us to be a religion with beliefs and practices! God is not stupid. He is a good salesman, selling us first what we want but most of all what we need. God could not sell us just to be connected to him and to know our egoistical self. We didn't want to buy. We were not prepared. We wanted to buy was what everyone around us were doing. Practice, ritual, hierarchy, a system, something palpable something you can feel.

So God sold us the Sinai covenant, but with a stipulation. "If" you succeed then you get Full peace and the Glory of God will be on you. Otherwise you go down to the lowest places man can go. Wait a second, your saying God lied! The salesman knows how to sell. A good salesman knows how to sell what you really need, while knowing what you think you want. God knows we could not succeed with the Sinai covenant, but as what he wanted to sell WAS NOT RELIGION he also gave a covenant to Abraham. A covenant which had no stipulation. The final result is the world redeemed, connecting to him knowing our egoistical selfish self.
