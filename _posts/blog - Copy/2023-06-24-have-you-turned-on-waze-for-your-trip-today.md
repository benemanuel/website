Have you turned on "waze" for your trip today?

Are we going on that same road as yesterday and the day before? Is the road available? Are things the same, or have they changed?
God want to guide us everyday, always. But he can only guide us if we turn on his "waze" and follow his path.

Do you want "waze"? Do you what to be on-line to God's instruction and direction? Or are you to busy...
