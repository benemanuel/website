You have learned a lot and are full of intellect, wisdom, knowledge and understanding.

But you still know nothing.

There are other ways of knowing things besides these.

Intuition: Intuition is a type of knowing that comes from within, often described as a gut feeling or a hunch. It is not based on conscious reasoning, but rather a sense of inner knowing.

Experience: Experience is a powerful way of knowing, as it involves direct interaction with the world around us. Through experience, we gain practical knowledge and learn how things work in real-world situations.

Emotion: Emotions can provide insight into our inner world and how we relate to the world around us. Sometimes our emotional reactions can provide us with a deep understanding of a situation or person.

Perception: Perception is the way we interpret sensory information from the world around us. It involves making meaning out of what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.

Imagination: Imagination is a creative way of knowing that involves the ability to form mental images or concepts that are not present in our immediate environment. It can help us to generate new ideas, explore possibilities, and solve problems in novel ways.

But you still know nothing.

Some you attempt to enlarge from learning, reflection, and practice. This involves seeking out information, analyzing it, and making connections between different pieces of information to deepen your understanding. While it is possible to develop and enhance all of them through intentional effort and practice.

You still know nothing.

Even using all these different ways of knowing and working them together to complement each other to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the world and our place in it.

You still know nothing.

Until God shows you his place, where it is and how he wants you to be there. What _could you know?_

You and your household must eat them annually before the LORD your God in the place **he chooses**. (Deut15:20)

לִפְנֵי֩ יְהֺוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֤יךָ תֹֽאכֲלֶ֨נּוּ֙ שָׁנָ֣ה בְשָׁנָ֔ה בַּמָּקֹ֖ום אֲשֶׁר־יִבְחַ֣ר יְהֺוָ֑ה אַתָּ֖ה וּבֵיתֶֽךָ׃ (דברים פרק טו פסוק כ)
