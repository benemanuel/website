We all hold the belief that everything will end well, but what is the nature of this game? God orchestrates salvation and places us in the Sabbath. Reflecting on Genesis 1:31, 'And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.' The Sabbath signifies an ending that is indeed very good.

The question arises: where do we stand until then? Are we active participants in God's plans and actions, akin to players in the game, or are we merely observers on the sidelines? Can the actor, who has read the play and practiced their parts, be compared to the audience? Who experiences fear when things unfold, and who remains tranquil? And crucially, who is ready for the next act, and who is not?

     We all believe that everything will end well, so what's the game? Indeed God makes salvation and puts us on the Sabbath. And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. (Genesis 1,31) Sabbath day which is that ends very well indeed. Where we are until then? Are we with him in His plans and actions as players or as guests on the side? Is the actor who has read the play and practiced his parts similar to the audience? Who felt fear when things happen? And who is quiet? Who is prepared for the next stanza who is not?
