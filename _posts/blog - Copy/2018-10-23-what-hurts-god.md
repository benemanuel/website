We're so busy with our shopping lists, what do I want and what do I dream.

We're so busy with pains and screams who gives a shit what God damn needs?

I come first my vacation or lust.

I come first my eye for must.

God gives and will give me more.

Will it be pain or my more and more?

I'm a good for nothing self pleaser at best.

But one thing I know is that God knows best.

(when did I start rappin ?????)
