"Worship the Lord with joy. Enter his presence with joyful singing." (Psalms 100,2)

Just as the Bible belongs to the people of Israel, the people of Israel belong to the Bible. All the people of Israel, whether with right-wing or left-wing views, whether with religious or secular views. Everyone has the Bible.

Some take it and cut it into small pieces. Historical, imperative, mystical, folkloric, intellectual, emotional, object sworn on, etc. The Bible has all of the above and lots more, but as a whole and not like slices that are out to dry. â€œBecause you have not served the Lord your God joyfully and wholeheartedly with the abundance of everything you have." (Deuteronomy 28,47)

And joy and kindness, is not that emotion. Many studies show the connection between music and emotion and mood and even memory and understanding. But music from the spirit source of God is much more than that, **because out of the singing and music comes the prophecy, which is the ultimate connection to God**. When you enter the town, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. They will have harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying. Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person. (1 Samuel 10, 5-6)

The whole Bible is poetry and melody, and the Bible is full of prophecy, since the signing of the Bible, the melody of the Bible has also disappeared to this day... With the revelation of authentic and original biblical music comes the emotion of the Spirit of the God and with it the connection and prophecy.

My goal is to publish easily accessible to all who want a connection to God and His Spirit and to the singing of the entire Bible. The poetry of the Bible is ancient and was created hand in hand with the biblical text by the authors of the Bible themselves. And according to this, anyone who searches for the various Diaspora melodies will not find them here. The Bible has no exiles from Ashkenazi or Spain or Yemen or any other exile (except the first exile from Egypt (in the creation of the people of Israel) and the second exile from Babylon / Persia)
