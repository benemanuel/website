I woke up in the middle of the night with a dream and which myself and others were in a situation of danger and all the classic ways of responding to it would only intensify the danger and not help us, and I saw in the dream that the only thing I could do was to do something different, something which was not your automatic response to such a situation. We actually did that and the danger dispersed.
