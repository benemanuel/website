The questions that come to mind have not come to mind to have definite answers to these questions, but more so to answer that what you think is an answer is not the correct answer.Now write down for yourselves the following song and teach it to the Israelites. Put it into their very mouths so that this song may serve as my witness against the Israelites! (Deut31:19)
