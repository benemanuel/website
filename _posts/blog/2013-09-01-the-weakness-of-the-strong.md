Many times I remainance on the past, asking myself why I allowed myself to stay in situations. which a normal person would run away from, while I stayed. Was I just a fool ? Or a brave man keeping his finger in the dam  believing  that it will not burst,      it cannot burst,          it must not burst,              I must do everything I can that it will not burst.   or a weakling that doesn't except the fact that the proper and right place for the water is on the other side.
