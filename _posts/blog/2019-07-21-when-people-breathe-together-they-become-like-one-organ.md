I am visiting Estonia now, and am hearing the how the singing of the people together helped create a national consciousness, and finally it's independence. It's independence has had it issues and so too, it's cultural identity, but the gathering around songs, language and 'breathing together' has done wonders for Estonian nationalism.

The people of Israel have a language and have songs which pre-date diaspora and can and will be the glue which will bond them together as on nation. It will be the source of their consciousness as was prophecized in the Bible that Israel will return to be united as one nation.
