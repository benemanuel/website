You can embrace a non-religious perspective while recognizing that the concept of God extends beyond any specific religious group, such as Jews. Exploring various spiritual practices like Kabbalah, Shamanism, Buddhism, and mind-body therapy is an option.

While you may attribute certain powers and wisdom to yourself, it's essential to acknowledge that they ultimately originate from a divine source. The belief in a positive outcome exists, but the question remains for whom it will manifest.

Individuals are empowered to choose their paths, guided by divine light to facilitate their development. Despite receiving guidance from God through tutorials, some may resist or avoid following this guidance.

 (Isaiah 22,13) _And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine--'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die!'_ 
 
 (Isaiah 10,17-20) _And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. And the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, he will consume both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man wasteth away. And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them down. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth._
 
 There is a recognition of the human tendency to indulge in momentary pleasures, neglecting personal responsibility. However, the promise of positive outcomes and the revelation of God's full power is underway, albeit hindered by the ego.

To experience this revelation fully, it is suggested to allow God to assist by setting aside one's ego for purification. This aligns with the teachings revealed by God's prophets, impacting both the global community and the people of Israel.


original:

You can be non-religious and believe that God does not belong only to Jews.

You can study Kabbalah, Shamanism, Buddhism, mind body therapy.

God gave you and powers and you thing they are yours. But they as his.

He also gave you wisdom and that you take for yourself.

Do you believe in 2012. And that everything will end well. And so it will but for who?

Sure you are that everyone chooses his own path with its way and that the divine light will guide him and pace his development accordingly.

You have already learned that everyone that is willing God sends him a tutorial, but you run away from his guidance.

(Isaiah 22,13) _And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine--'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die!'_

That no shortage of reasons to party, and who can be without food? That if everything ends for the best Why should I take responsibility for my life.

(Isaiah 10,17-20) _And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day. And the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, he will consume both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man wasteth away. And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them down. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth._

That good will happen and the revelation of God in its FULL power has already begun (Step by step) but the ego burns and hurts.

Allowing God to help putting aside your ego. So that you will purify.

And it's true the whole world and people of Israel and God's teachings revealed by His prophets.
