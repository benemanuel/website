You can attempt time and time again to talk, explain, coerce me to understand you.

I am not interested to listening, and I find your mere attempts disturbing.

There is no place for discourse.

There is no ability to find acceptance in one another.

There is not point of connection.

Please donâ€™t get this wrong. It hurts me no less then you.

I wish and pray we could talk, debate, understand and accept each other options.

But that place that you are is so wrong, so much stuck in the ego, so far away from anything true and Godly.

Only God can open up your heart and soul.

I wish I could help, but the miracle to bring life to a dead stick was not given to me.

My connection to you can only be from the spirit of God.

Shed your exoskeleton of humaneness and embrace Gods spirit.

(Sam 2 Chap 19,1) And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said: 'O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!'

Absalom a dear son to David, good at talking he ways around is gone. His talk got him nowhere. But his talk was dear to David.
