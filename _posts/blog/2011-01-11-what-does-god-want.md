God did not desire Abraham to actually sacrifice his beloved only son. Instead, God wanted Abraham to demonstrate a willingness to go against his natural instincts, thereby transcending human nature or, in other words, the self-controlled "I." This willingness would lead to liberation from the constraints of human nature, allowing for the emergence of a liberated self or, in other words, a "Godly I." Consequently, Abraham retained his innate kindness and ascended to become "Abraham the kind," a vessel for the Divine Presence.

You are the LORD God who chose Abram and brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldeans. You changed his name to Abraham. (Nehemiah 9:7)

original:

God did not want that Abraham sacrifice his only son that he loved. But he did wanted Abraham to be willing to sacrifice his son. That willingness to do anything opposite to our “nature”, thus freeing us of human nature or in other words the self-controlled ”I”. And releasing us to a free me or in other words a “Godly I”. Thus Abraham never stopped being the kindly Abraham but rose up to be “Abraham the kind” chariot of the Divine Presence.

You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
