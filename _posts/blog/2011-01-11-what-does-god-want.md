God did not want that Abraham sacrifice his only son that he loved. But he did wanted Abraham to be willing to sacrifice his son. That willingness to do anything opposite to our “nature”, thus freeing us of human nature or in other words the self-controlled ”I”. And releasing us to a free me or in other words a “Godly I”. Thus Abraham never stopped being the kindly Abraham but rose up to be “Abraham the kind” chariot of the Divine Presence.

You are the Lord God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
