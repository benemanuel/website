Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, hut now am found,

Was blind, but now I see.

…

How precious did that grace appear,

The hour I first believed! (John Newton 1779)

That feeling of wretchedness that one feels.

That “how do thoughts like this cross my mind?” thought.

That “what good am I?” or “I’m just a good for nothing” depressed attitude.

Are all the same side of the coin.

The other side is:

God is great.

God is loving and merciful.

God is the one and only to be praised and glorified.

God is the purpose of life and living.

When we relate to one side without it’s other. We are just liars and cheats.

The coin is whole and comes as one.

It can’t be divided.
