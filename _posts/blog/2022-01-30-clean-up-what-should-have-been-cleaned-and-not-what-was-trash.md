I commented on this article [https://www.timesofisrael.com/french-historian-claims-israel-abetted-1967-razing-of-jerusalems-mughrabi-quarter](https://www.timesofisrael.com/french-historian-claims-israel-abetted-1967-razing-of-jerusalems-mughrabi-quarter) and it seems to have disappeared so I tried a second time and this time made a copy.

They should have razed and cleaned up Temple Mount instead of creating the grand Wailing Wall plaza.
