Israel and the Palestinians: What are alternatives to a two-state solution?

Emeritus professor, SOAS

Starts off stating

**"Origin of partition**

To understand where the concept of sharing or dividing this piece of land comes from, it is important to look at its recent past.

Arab nationalism and Jewish nationalism arose during the same period of history with claims to the same territory. This rationale was the underlying basis for an equitable solution, based on partition and a two-state solution."

Some questions:

1\. Same time?

2\. Arab = the Arabs living in Israel ("Palestine nationalism")?

Some answers:

1\. Modern Jewish nationalism is a direct non stopping continuation of the quest to return which existed since the being of the diaspora, and grew intense from the 1600's

2\.
