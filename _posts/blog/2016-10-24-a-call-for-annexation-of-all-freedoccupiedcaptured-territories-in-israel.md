Hope and not despair is that answer. The question of hope for what?

Those who call for autonomy of the Arab population in Israel, imagine that this will help the populations self-pride and better their livelihood.

I believe otherwise. The **links** following show that my belief has a serious base when we look at suicide rate of the Arab population in Israel and those in the autonomous areas.

I call for annexation of all freed/occupied/captured territories in Israel.

I also call that Arab population should not be allowed political self-determination.

The basic proof for this is as seen the political parties which the greater majority of the Arab population vote for, do not look for the good of the population that they represent.

The people of Israel have been tested time and again and proven that they do not look cast aside the need of those who live within us and are foreign to us.
