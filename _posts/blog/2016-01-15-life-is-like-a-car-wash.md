You have to enter to get cleaned. You have to let go and allow the cleaning process to take place.

There isn't much more to it, except maybe going in again for a redoing.

God in his infinite patience and love can not clean us without our willingness to be cleaned. In the cleansing process we have to go into neutral otherwise it doesn't work. Patience the process will finish, running around will not make it faster. God knows our blemishes better then we do. Let him do the job.
