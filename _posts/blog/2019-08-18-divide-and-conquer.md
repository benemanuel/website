The twelve sons of Jacob, God's nation, were one and will return to be one.

As God promised in the words of his prophets, he will take them from the four corners of the earth and he will make them into an undivided nation under God.

But the powers that don't want the NATION OF ISRAEL to be one, work overtime to create division and disagreement wherever and however it can.

The religious power pulls one way, so the secular pulls the other way and vice-versa. The right pulls one way, so the left pulls the other way and vice-versa. Is this what God wants? Does he not want his nation to be one, but not just that; one nation under God.

Are we willing to leave our comfort zone? Did the continuous reminders of the Bible "Therefore you are to love the foreigner, since you were foreigners in the land of Egypt." help make us who we are? Did the diaspora and exile not awaken us?

God awaits us. He is awaiting our call "Because you refused when I called, and no one paid attention when I put out my hand"

The religous as well as the secular, the right as well as the left, must stop their fighting and accept God.They must accept that they do not have a monopoly on what is right or wrong, nor do they have God in their pocket. They must also understand and accept that their leaders and acclaimed authorities are no less than troublemakers, who are striving to control our hearts and minds.

And God willing, we will see this prophecy, that is so hard to envision, that all of us will be standing as one nation, happening quickly.
