What have I learnt that helps make good food?

love and patience.

What about good sex?

love and patience.

This is also true with good money.

There is bad money, bad sex and bad food.

It’s fast and with no heart.

The same is true with life and relationships.

The “secret” of a good one is … love and patience.

And if all the above is true, then why shouldn’t it be so with God?

Do I want a good connection with him? Am I putting into that connection my … love and patience?

I will note that evil also wants us to give it love and patience.

But shit does not need to stand around and collect flies, it needs to be flushed down quickly.
