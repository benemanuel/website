Again I stand before the welfare officer who gives a report to the judge who decides how the connection between me and my children will be according to the laws of the state. If this is similar to what was until now, it looked like this: You shall submit a written declaration and a hand written approval of their mother to the courts secretary at least 48 hours before ... then I will decide. So it was on my son's Bar Mitzvah. Unfortunately it's not a joke.

What can I do with all this absurdity? Until now the wall hears better.

God, I know you take care of matters. God just give me the power and patience, and safe being to pass it safely. Because you know what I would do for my children, they are your children. I trust you're doing for me, your beloved son.
