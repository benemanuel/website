Lawyers Politicians and Salesmen have a job to write out words that sell with no personal obligation. This trickery costs us time and time again the belief that we will be getting what was promised while we continue to wait (best case) or buy again and again (still not worst case) or convince others that while the promised has yet to be fulfilled, they should invest in it also.

I personally have been burnt. Hopeful only once, but as the time of product arriving gets delayed again and again, probably twice.

The story is simple. 1- Promise the sky. 2- Show "proofs" 3- Give timetable 4- Allow to cancel by date of ... 5- Add promises 6- Add ... 7- Allow the date to pass 8- Give new timetable of delivery 9- Tell a sad story 10- Give new timetable of delivery 11- Either - disappear - continue to sell with promises - give new timetable of delivery 12- Never deliver or deliver to a few usually a bad product.

P.S. Religions do the same all the time
