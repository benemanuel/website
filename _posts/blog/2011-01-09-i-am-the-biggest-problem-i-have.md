If not for me everything would working out. I would always be doing all the right things. I would never be mistaken, and the most important,

I would not bother myself to do and want, **what I really want**.

But in the meantime I'm such a bother to myself that if God did not hold tight I don't know what I would do (to myself).

I am thankfully aware to you God, that you have showed me (a little) how I bother you from allowing myself to realize my true self (which is basically His)

I've had enough of my damned self that messes up my life that only You can release me from it.
