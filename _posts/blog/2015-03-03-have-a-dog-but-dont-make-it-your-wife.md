I, like some others around have a dog. Well not a real dog but almost a real one.

What I mean is that I eat, sleep, need to walk, love getting attention etc... just like a dog. I also get irritated when I feel someone is attempting to get into my territory, just like a dog.

On the day by day my dog needs it's caring and relating to. But I can't see that my main purpose in life and the reason I'm here to live, is for it. I don't forget it, nor do I treat it badly. What I try to make sure is that it knows who the boss is and who is guiding who.

When I come to doing anything which "has a purpose" or is "good for something" I try to remember that the boss who sill be doing this has NOT TO BE THE DOG.

Good dog, have a biscuit and go to the corner now.
