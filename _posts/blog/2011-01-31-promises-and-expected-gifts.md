When your boss promises a raise or even your monthly salary, it's natural to start planning expenses in anticipation. But bosses can change their minds; today they promise, and tomorrow those promises might vanish. So, the question arises: What are their words truly worth?

On the other hand, God promises comfort, and that promise is unwavering. It's a commitment set in stone.

The reality of this divine promise is so profound that if, for some reason, you don't see it immediately, understand that it is more real than many tangible things we see and often rely on.
