Fear-mongering is a pastime of those who want to pull us from God, serenity and his ultimate truth.

They do so attempting to grab control over our lives.

The same is true wither the topic is climate, disease, privacy or finance, just to name a few.

When fear comes up and it does time and time again.

The first and only right direction is to put our lives, fate, and faith in God.

I will basically be saying what is written here (except God isn't christen) https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/lie-privacy-world-data-mining/
