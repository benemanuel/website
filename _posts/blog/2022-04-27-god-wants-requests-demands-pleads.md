When God puts forward a statement, not all are identical.Some seem like dry statements others his wishes, while even more like "this is really bad", or this is going to kill you. The scale goes from a gentle one of hints to harsh words and curses.

As a parent, we have our wants and wills and we understand that our children do not see eye to eye with everything we will. At times we hint, others standright and say it, while others demand. While some children can ignore these hints, they find it more difficult to ignore demands. We wish that the hints were enough, but why aren't they?

We all have our levels of comfort. The scale of this goes from "I would love to do this", to "I hate and will not do this". There is plenty of ground between these two extremes.

When God or the parent wants something which is very comforting, we are happy to do it. When it is less comfortable we start deliberating if to do it or not. The more we have to leave our comfort zone, the more the wish has to become a demand for it to be done.

This isn't good. Today we have to open up our hearts and eyes for the subtle message from God and leave our comfort zone and not wait anymore for the last minute demand. For demands have a tendency of not coming in a gentle fashion. And God's love for us demands that we don't wait for that.
