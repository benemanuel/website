Scary coming close to God. Didn't some touch and get burnt ? Who needs it ?

Is it worth the cost ? Why can't I just live my life like a normal person ?

Where is this normal life taking us ? Are we not all destined to death ? Is this life worth living if it is not for being with God ?

And how are those who are running away from God ? Who wants to be with these cursed people ?

Do we not want to be part of the celebration of redemption ? Or is it just another affair which can be passed by for another time ?

Do we not want, what we have seen in our own eyes ? Is not the good and graciousness of God, to be for others ?

God, see what is in me which hurts. And take me to your world.
