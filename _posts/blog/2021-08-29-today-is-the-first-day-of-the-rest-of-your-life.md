When I started blogging in 2004 I started with the question of how to start" [https://aviwollman.wordpress.com/2004/12/20/how-to-start/](https://aviwollman.wordpress.com/2004/12/20/how-to-start/)A while has passed since then and so has my personal development. Today I start being officially unemployed as I have voluntarily taken an unpaid vacation so that I contemplate living with no human as my employer. I am starting, and even now that one question jumps in to find its place. That place of organization within the chaos of existence. The supposed answer of "how to start". God has truly worked on me over the years and has shown me time and time again that he is the organization of this chaotic world, he is the one that "Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water. God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light" So as God as my light I will be here with him to allow him to be my guide. "So the Israelites did everything the Lord commanded Moses; that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the way they set out, each of them with their clan and family."
