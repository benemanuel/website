Life is like a maze, so many things get you soooo close. But then when you hit the wall the only thing you can do is backtrack.

A few with fame are Religion (ALL), spirituality, back to nature. 

You say you just want to get ahead but to what ?! There is a purpose in life. There is  a place where inside (your inner spirit) you really want to go to.

Are you willing to see that wall that your knocking your head in ? Or do you prefer knocking harder ignoring the pain (or even worse saying that this pain is for your good [yes stupid it's there to wake you up])

God loves you and talks directly to your soul. Don't ignore him. These are the instructions to pass through the maze of life and to reach Him in the end.
