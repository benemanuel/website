We fall into the rabbit hole we call "reality" and imagine we understand it's rules.

The real rules are not where we imagine. We think we have them under control just when we find ourselves falling into a new hole.

The limits of these holes are the limits to our imagination. The truth is not there at all.

Sure, some truths pop up here and there. But they disappear like the spilled water on a summer pavement.

When will we stop, look and listen?

When will we allow the spirit to enter us?

Or will we try again, so full of ourselves, that we will finally find out that we do not have to tools to find the answer.

The wakeup call is here. The bells are ringing. But we turnover to find the next rabbit hole to dream on into.

When was the last time you asked yourself AM I READY TO DO WHAT GOD WHATS?

When was the last time you knew what was right AND DID IT EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE AROUND YOU STATED OTHERWISE?

When did you stop quoting and said what your heart really feels?

When did you accept that God loves and wants the best for you more the you can imagine?

Sorry to inform those who imagine it but the answers cannot be found at dead ends like:

1\. Teacher, Rabbis, Ministers, Guru, Priest, Mentor, Mullah etc

2\. Scientists, Academicians etc

3\. Evolutionaries, Revolutionaries

4\. Arei's .

5\. Religion, Secularism

6\. Ism's .

7\. Right wing politics, Left wing politics

8\. Politics .

אני יהוה בעתה אחישנה (ישעיהן ס, כב)

When the right time comes, I the Lord will quickly do this! (Isa 60,22)
