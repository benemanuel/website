1.   
    keep up with the  
    pressure until you bomb out.  
2. freeze up  
3. just floke out (go  brezork)  
4. try to ride the wave.  
    keeping you cool.  
5. run away  
6. do what you can and feel you can do and feel unresponsible for the rest.  
7. call for help.

I think that God prefers asking him for help then anything else listed.  
This can be true only when we are doing thing for his glory and not for ourselves.
