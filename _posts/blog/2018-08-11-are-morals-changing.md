Those who believe morals change, whether by time or culture or society. Do not believe in a single omnipresent God. They "play" that morals of today will differ from tomorrow and yesterdays morals are not of today's. They claim no Judge nor Judgment nor Judgment day as they imagine the game they play. God knows better, his morality has never changed. His judgment is one and true and timeless.
