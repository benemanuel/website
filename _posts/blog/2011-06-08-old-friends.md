An old friend came on knocking. Reminding me too much why I preferred him not around. For sure I've known him since I was wee. Always imagining that I could not be without him. Well times have changed and life goes on and I'm finally understanding things differently than a yonder. So please dear friend, go and do not stay for I prefer my life without you.

Ecclesiastes 4,13 Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
