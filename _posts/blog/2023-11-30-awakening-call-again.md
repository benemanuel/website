The Awakening of the dry bones.
At first the call was given to come back to the land of Israel the place of our forefathers.
There were those who heard and those who weren't willing to hear the call. 
The evil seemed to be let free and the Nazi regime and sympathizers did what they did. The evil was always there but God's protection was felt less after the call.

And that's the dry bones connected one the two another and created a body as in the state of Israel was created with all the elements of the body, the police, the army, the judicial system, the government, etc. 

This body was created and was built up as no country in the world developed. But the spirit was missing.
The mission of the nation to be the light among the nations was seen by the people of Israel in confusing and conflicting ways, leaving them in turmoil and divided.

The second call came out, the call for the Spirit, few heard it. Like the previous call it wasn't just once, it reverberated again and again. The  call for the Spirit  stretched over decades.
There were those who heard and those who weren't willing to hear the call.
The evil seemed to be let free and the Hamas terrorists and sympathizers did what they did.  The evil was always there but God's protection was felt less after the call.
So we are yet to see the body rise as God's spirit enters it.
That same spirit which connects all the tribes of Israel to be one.
That same spirit which knows its mission to be the light among the nations and by being together is not confused and conflicted.

There are still some who are not ready to hear.
*Then some people said, “Come on! Let us consider how to deal with Jeremiah! There will still be priests to instruct us, wise men to give us advice, and prophets to declare God’s word. Come on! Let’s bring charges against him and get rid of him! Then we will not need to pay attention to anything he says.”*

*Then I said,*

*"Lord, pay attention to me.  
Listen to what my enemies are saying.  
Should good be paid back with evil?  
Yet they are virtually digging a pit to kill me.  
Just remember how I stood before you  
pleading on their behalf  
to keep you from venting your anger on them."* (Jeremiah 18:18-20)

But nevertheless there must be an entry of  God's Spirit entering it, the nations of the world will fear and renowned Israel. As stated "*Then all the peoples of the earth will see that you belong to the Lord, and they will respect you.*" (Deuteronomy 28:10)

But not all. We still have Gog and Magog to face.

Challenges and aspirations has the nation of Israel. The call for the Spirit and the anticipation of God's presence shaping your destiny is why you were chosen in the first place.
