And God said unto Israel no one shall leave their homes for I will send the Angel of Death upon the world and who is outside will be smitten.And Israel (mostly) did what God commanded and pretty much were saved.

Then God gave Ten Commandments. And God said just follow these commandments and live. And Israel looked at the commandments and said these commandments are not comfortable for us. And Israel preferred imported idols than God's commandments, they sought out idols from the diaspora of the nations which Israel lived for many millennia. Among them were:

1. the idol of democracy
2. the idol of personal freedom
3. the idol of privacy
4. the idol of religion

God did not ask for much, only to trust and love him and follow his simple commandments.

What can save us? Our acceptance that God loves and guides us if we are willing to be guided.

Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor; the Lord responds when I cry out to him. (Psalms 4:4)
