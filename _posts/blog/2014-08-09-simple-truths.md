1\. Allah is not God. 2. Muhammad is not Gods messenger. 3. Jesus is not God, nor is he Gods only son, any more than you or me. 4. Being right does not need to be proven. 5. There is only one God. The God of goodness, kindness, mercy and love. 6. God does not tolerate his name used in vain. 7. Truth is not relative.
