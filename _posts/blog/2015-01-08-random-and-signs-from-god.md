Once I understood that what I thought was random or luck, were in essence things that God was sending me to take notice of. I started seeing patterns and direction.

What once was just taken and ignored like some pain somewhere in my body, or someone saying something which bothered me and such. Suddenly became spotlights pointing to a purpose in life and what I should be living for.

There are plenty of times that I have ignored these signs. But God doesn't forget his son and gives me a nice nudge to wake up.

Sometimes I yearn for a sign or direction. That prayer doesn't always come with answers which I understand. The reasons for I might only figure out years later, while others maybe never. For direction always comes, but am I ready to receive it?

משלי פרק טז, לג: בַּחֵיק יוּטַל אֶת הַגּוֹרָל - וּמֵיְהֹוָה כָּל מִשְׁפָּטוֹ

I can ask for a random answer, but God will guide me even with these answers.

נחמיה פרק ח, פסוק ח: וַיִּקְרְאוּ בַסֵּפֶר בְּתוֹרַת הָאֱלֹהִים מְפֹרָשׁ וְשׂוֹם שֶׂכֶל וַיָּבִינוּ בַּמִּקְרָא

I can read from the Bible, but I need the spirit of God to understand what is wanted.

  ישעיהו פרק לד פסוקים טז-יז דִּרְשׁוּ מֵעַל סֵפֶר יְהֹוָה וּקְרָאוּ אַחַת מֵהֵנָּה לֹא נֶעְדָּרָה אִשָּׁה רְעוּתָהּ לֹא פָקָדוּ כִּי פִי הוּא צִוָּה וְרוּחוֹ הוּא קִבְּצָן: וְהוּא הִפִּיל לָהֶן גּוֹרָל וְיָדוֹ חִלְּקַתָּה לָהֶם בַּקָּו עַד עוֹלָם יִירָשׁוּהָ לְדוֹר וָדוֹר יִשְׁכְּנוּ בָהּ:

 I like looking into the book of the LORD, and reading; the thought that we are all God's children and he thinks and cares for all of use is reinforced. There is no random lot's just signs and directions, and whoever is willing to look at them will be guided, and then God will dwell within him.
