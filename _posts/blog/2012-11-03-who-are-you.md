WHO IS GOD? Have we ever really tried to know God as He really is?

The Bible says that He is alive, He has a body, and He feels emotions. This is not an anthropomorphic metaphor, because God is not just a "spiritual force" his is first and foremost (from how he has disclosed himself to us) a person.

An eminent scientist wrote about life after death that the brain consciousness during clinical death was like in another dimension, there was a change in the state of consciousness that we call another physical reality. Similarly, God is in this other physical reality, a parallel world to ours. since we refused to be angelic beings by touching the forbidden tree. We are closed to the world of God (our Father sees us more: "But the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?") To open up to the fallen world in which we live even now.

Now everyone has a different vision of God, influenced by his upbringing, religious or not, his relationship to his parents, his culture ... we all see God through a prism that distorts him.

But God is above all a grieving father weeping for his children and never ceases to call them back to Him.
