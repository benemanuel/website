This is who I am, this is who I think I am, this is what I imagine I am, this is what my ego enjoys STOP BOTHERING ME.

This is NOT what I should be, this is NOT what I want to be, this is what my ego enjoys and IT IS DISTURBING the peace that I must have.

God, thank you for allowing me to see my EGOTISTICAL self. God, thank you for allowing be to be disturbed by it's existence. God, thank you for not wanting it and wanting that ME that exists with you coexistent.
