When will my life be “good” with no problems.

No matter what language or culture one might have, what is that life filled with pursuit of happiness?

God sends me to Isaiah 21:11-12 to remind me.

This is an oracle about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?” The watchman replies, “Morning is coming, but then night. If you want to ask, ask; come back again.”

I don’t want that will be “a life of peaches and crea”?

But what life am I talking about. A life with God or my humanity.

I sees darkness and hardship and is looking and yearning for light.

The watchman jokes and tells soon, soon and come again to check whenever you like.

The watchman knows.

The watchman knows that to morning will come, but not while I am looking for a life of peaches and cream in my humanoid shell.

The sun which is the glory of God will arise and his light will fill the world.

The Glory of God is the real life, not the human one.

When will I/we rejoice and allow God to fill us with his redemption?

Only then will like really be “Tutim”
