I am angry I am angry and sad I am angry, sad and disgusted I am angry, sad, disgusted and enraged

About ... About a brother who will not meet with his only sister unless his demands are met. About a daughter who will not allow a grandfather to meet with his only grandchildren unless her demands are held. About a seven-year-old who will not meet his mother unless his demands are met. About a mother who denies contact of a father with his teenage children unless her demands are met.

These actions stem from a longing for control, which is a form of power. The thirst for power comes from a disbelief in God; a thirst for power ultimately results in theft, rape and murder. A person who genuinely believes in God feels that nothing is ultimately his, and therefore does not have a need for control and power.

God is the true judge and righteousness and justice are His and His alone.
