there are two sides in the coin of life

each one completely different

but only when we see both as two different sides  is the coin worth anything

side one (the head) of our coin is

I WANT GOD IS TO SHOW HIMSELF ON OUR (THIS) WORLD

the second side (the tail)  of our coin is

MY EGO IS BOTHERING ME TO BE ONE WITH GOD

we will need to find ways to see our ego

pray that God shows it to us

pray to distinguish the sides

what the coin to be one

only then with

GOD ONE AND HIS NAME ONE
