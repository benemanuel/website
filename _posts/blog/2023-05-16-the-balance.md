We hear people wanting a balance in life. A balance between what exactly? 
A balance like the YinYang? A balance between negatives like good and evil?

Isn't that nice? Don't we enjoy hearing things like this?
Don't we all just want to HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT (TOO).
Are we willing at all to hear the truth?

God is willing to show us his truth. He is willing to enter our hearts and open them. If we are willing...

When we are born, our humanity/humaneness is born with us. God also plants within each of us his spirit.
Our existence is to embrace his spirit as the basis of our existence and completely put aside our frail and lying humanity.
There is no balance between our humanity and God's spirit.
There is only ongoing war with no peace-fires.
Satan sells us balance, telling us that we can have both spiritually and humanity. 
But only if we forgo completely to God's spirit can we start to live.
And it's not "just once" It is an ongoing process.

“Look! I have set before you today life and prosperity on the one hand, and death and disaster on the other.
What I am commanding you today is to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to obey his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances. Then you will live and become numerous and the LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are about to possess.(Deut 30:15-16)
