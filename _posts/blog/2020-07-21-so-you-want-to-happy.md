So I recommend the happiness and enjoyment of life, for there is nothing better on earth for a person to do except to eat, drink, and be happy. So joy will accompany him in his toil during the days of his life that God gives him on earth. (Ecclesiastes\[Kohelet\] 8:15)

Is this Happiness? Is this Life?

Then Jethro, Mosesâ€™ father-in-law,

brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God,

and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came

to eat food with the father-in-law of Moses before God. (Exodus 18:12)

To eat and drink with God. This world of existence has no purpose , no joy nor happiness, except with God.

You lead me in the path of life.

I experience absolute joy in your presence;

you always give me sheer delight. (Psalms 16:11)
