What a thought-provoking question! What exactly defines a "scratch"?

As I contemplate this query, my initial reaction is to dismiss it. Why bother pondering such matters? However, life has a funny way of bringing back what you choose to ignore. Perhaps it's worth paying attention to this concept of a "scratch," considering it seems to be an integral part of who I am. Even others, when asked about me, recognize its presence.

So, let's examine these "scratches" in my life. I pride myself on being honest and straightforward. Deception and cheating are challenging for me. Despite the advice I've received from many who suggest bending the rules, I find such ideas difficult to embrace.

It's not that I lack the skill or knowledge. A few years ago, I faced a precarious situation with a contractor, risking substantial financial loss. I managed to maintain a poker face, and after he invested every last cent I had previous payed, I promptly ended the association. Unfortunately, my neighbors didn't fare as well.

Another "scratch" involves education. My father the teacher seems to have left an indelible mark on me. The idea of cheating becomes even more challenging when I consider my role as a parent. How can I teach my children values if I indulge in dishonesty?

Some may argue that a certain level of deception is acceptable, but I contend that any virtue not derived from a divine source is inherently flawed. True goodness, in my belief, is exemplified by actions rooted in a higher purpose.

In my quest for spiritual alignment, I seek release from worldly temptations, allowing me to wholeheartedly embrace the divine will.

What a question!? What is a scratch?

So while I face this question, the first thing I do is move on. What do I need questions like this? But like everything in life what you put it aside, it comes back on your next turn. So I should give it some notice, as this "scratch" from what I understand is just part of me and "I". Even to the point that if you asked others about me it shows up.

Well then I'll count a few scratches. I am honest & straight. Yes it is hard for me to pull a fast one or to cheat. Almost everyone who heard the experiences I'm going through, give me advice to cheating, lie in one way or another. I find these ideas very hard.

It's not that I do not know how or don't have the ability. A few years ago I had a rogue state with a contractor and stood to lose a lot of money. I succeeded playing with a poker face, while he invested to the last cent I gave me, then I sent him away. The neighbors were not as lucky like me.

Another scratch is educator. The teacher of my father must have his blood flowing within me. And it adds to the difficulty of cheating because I have kids. Educate them to cheating and lie how can I ?

Some say not bad. At least this its a bad virtue. I say a virtue not coming from God, is bad. Good is like " ... And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. "

God please me release, so that I can indulge in your wants wholeheartedly.
