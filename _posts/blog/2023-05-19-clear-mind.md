Once my mind is clear you don’t want to mess with me. (Scott Adams)

A cleared mind has made the decision that no matter the consequences it has its purpose and path.

That place of checking and figuring and wondering have gone. Now is that time of action.

Clear minds cut through bullshit better then anything, just be careful that it isn’t just an adrenaline high.
