In a world where distinguishing truth from lies feels like navigating a confusing maze, I grapple with the interplay of mercy and truth. Does truth lose its relevance when mercy prevails, or does mercy lack purpose without the anchor of truth?

Amidst a barrage of falsehoods, I recognize that genuine and complete truth relies on the embrace of mercy. It also becomes evident that relying solely on mercy risks perpetuating the very evils it should dispel.

Inspired by the wisdom of Proverbs 3:3, I embark on a journey to make mercy and truth my unwavering companions. I envision them encircling me, weaving into the core of my existence, and imprinting their essence onto the tablet of my feelings.
חֶ֥סֶד וֶֽאֱמֶ֗ת אַֽל־יַעַ֫זְבֻ֥ךָ קָשְׁרֵ֥ם עַל־גַּרְגְּרֹותֶ֑יךָ כָּ֝תְבֵ֗ם עַל־ל֥וּחַ לִבֶּֽךָ׃(משלי פרק ג פסוק ג)

In the expansive realm of justice and truth, I perceive a dynamic scale influenced by the intricacies of God's will. Although His teachings may be elusive, they illuminate my path and provide me with purpose.

Maintaining constant self-awareness becomes my guiding principle as I confront my flaws and sins. The deep intertwining of my ego with my existence prompts me to question its dominance, "Is it my core identity?" or is there more to discover?

Amid this internal struggle, a profound realization dawns on me: "God exists in my reality." His mercy serves as the key to breaking free from the chains of falsehood. Though I am full of falsehoods, He doesn't desert me, allowing for the reconstruction of my human heart into a godly one.

The ongoing need for God's mercy becomes a guiding light, prompting me to align righteousness with my belief in myself. In this intertwining, the grace and mercy of God weave the threads that compose the fabric of my renewed existence.
