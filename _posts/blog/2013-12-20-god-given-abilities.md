While God brought us into this world, he did so that we may live. Any live we do, if we are willing to choose the path of life. With our birth, and not only then, we are placed at the crossroads of life and death.

This crossroad is that place were the Ego or that automatic path from living to dying, are to one direction. While on the other side is God's guidance, putting the Ego aside, and going from death to living.

I feel again that crossroad in my life. That push to do and succeed at all costs. That need to be seen as a good doer. That fear of being failure or being seen as one. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I reach out for God and his guidance. I allow my Ego to be hurt, the one of success, the one of companionship, the one one of doing, the one of being right, the one helping out, the one that is seen as a helper, good, okay guy.
