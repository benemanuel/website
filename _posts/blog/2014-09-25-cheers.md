There went the day of CHEERS. A yearly HOLIDAY. The day of CHEERS is a special one and a different one. It is a day of thanksgiving and remembering the thanksgiving of the past. It is the opening Festival of  a month full of festivals all around the topic of THANK YOU.  The autumn is the end of the harvesting and bringing what has grown over the last year. We gave thank for this year and if it wasn't the best, we give thanks for previous years.  So thankfulness is in place.

God called this day the day of CHEERS, for some strange reason people confused Cheering with horn blowing. I can only imagine that as on some occasions a nice blow of a horn comes before the cheer, they figured that all cheers must have a horn blowing. What I can't figure is why they forgot to cheer and only left the horn blowing?
