It’s great that feeling of being in Gods hand and that he knows what’s best for you.

Even when all your eyes, logic and feeling tell you otherwise. His spirit picks you up to highs above.

The world around us can attempt explain why we must live in lies and that truthfulness is unacceptable.

So they explain, so they punish, so they try to save their skins. For judgment for all the lies and treachery will be given.

And I have a life to live so I will not bother with what I can’t.

But I will pray that God presence on earth will be felt more and that his judgment will be seen soon.
