A Political Thought.

So Mr. Putin put forward his demands for Mr. Zelensky to lose the Donbas region, committing to remain out of NATO, and saving his people from further war and destruction - or keep fighting.

I have a proposal. I recommend Mr. Zelensky to agree, but on certain terms.

- As a democracy Ukrainian president can't decide this on his own. So a referendum ratified by the UN would take place within 30-60 days nationwide, to ratify this agreement.
- Immediate stopping of all aggression, and withdrawal of all Russian forces.

This is a win-win. If it is ratified then there is a peaceful withdrawal and agreements. If not, the entire nation of Ukraine is backing the fight against these actions and not just some individuals.

Russia as I understand it needs a feeling of self determination and existence, which is being threatened by the Ukrainian pull to the west. Let the government structure which the Ukrainian people have accepted as their guidance, guide them.
