When I witnessed the Arab Spring, I can't help but feel a profound connection to the yearning for justice, freedom, and truth among the people. It's inspiring to see individuals standing up against oppression. Yet, there's a worry lingering in my mind that amidst this pursuit, some might be led astray, veering towards extremism.

I truly believe that the longing for independence from tyranny is a shared sentiment among both Arab and Jewish communities. In particular, I feel that those in Zion should unite with their Arab counterparts as brothers in the pursuit of truth and justice.

Despite the challenges and the potential for misunderstanding, I hold onto the conviction that divine plans will lead to liberation. I reject the notion of seeking security in the stability of governments led by tyrants or criminals. For me, the ultimate security lies in embracing divine truth and justice, ensuring a better future for all of God's children.

When I see the Arab people out into the streets demanding judgment of the ruling government, judgment of tyranny, judgment of the lie. I tell myself there is a God!

Any chance the peoples who lived so many years on the basis of lies and oppression of self-freedom to get up and want the truth and justice.

I also feel that the Jewish people especially those in Zion should not hesitate a second and go for truth and justice and reach out as brothers to the Arab people who yearn and demand independence from tyranny.

There is no place to fear the false Islam, God has plans and that liberation will come.

Divine truth and justice for all God's children is the best security and safety. Not like those who look for security in a stable government of tyrants or criminals.

God wins!
