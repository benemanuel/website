When I see the Arab people out into the streets demanding judgment of the ruling government, judgment of tyranny, judgment of the lie. I tell myself there is a God!

Any chance the peoples who lived so many years on the basis of lies and oppression of self-freedom to get up and want the truth and justice.

I also feel that the Jewish people especially those in Zion should not hesitate a second and go for truth and justice and reach out as brothers to the Arab people who yearn and demand independence from tyranny.

There is no place to fear the false Islam, God has plans and that liberation will come.

Divine truth and justice for all God's children is the best security and safety. Not like those who look for security in a stable government of tyrants or criminals.

God wins!
