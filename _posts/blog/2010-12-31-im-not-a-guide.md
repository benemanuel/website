I do not your or any one's guide, teacher, counselor, mentor, instructor or bridge. God is the teacher, guide and the father for all, just people running away from his guidance.

(Jeremiah 31,33) and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying: 'Know the LORD'; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.

You should start getting used to it.

That the amount of people you notice that they hear the word of God straight is growing day by day.

This is one of the most prominent signs of the end of days.

Let no one will tell you that only way you will find salvation. This person is a thief. Taking gifts of God for himself.

And give up that simple dream that one can live without God.

That's it finished. He has entered our life of you desire or not. Only now you have to deal with presence of God in your life. (what joy to those who prepared themselves)
