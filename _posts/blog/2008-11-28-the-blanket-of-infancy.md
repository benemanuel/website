האם אני עדין מחזיק בסמיכה ?

[![](assets/images/linus.png "linus")](http://aviwollman.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/linus.png)charlie brown looks on and wonders how long will it be until linus will free himself from the blanket of infancy and begin taking on his real destiny in life. he looks worried for he sees the linus is "seemingly" quiet and self contained with his situation. for linus imagines that responsibility is for others. but chalie brown needs him for the responsibility is to great.
