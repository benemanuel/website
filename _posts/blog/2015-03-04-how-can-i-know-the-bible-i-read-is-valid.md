I know = Knowledge is king, the need to know, no more room for spirit, and no place for belief.

the Bible = what is the Bible, "the book" is it exact or full of mistakes ?

Is God dead? Are his words dead? God and his spirit are here and alive waiting for all that come with humility to accept it. The spirit of God and his words are alive in the people of Israel. If you want to find that ultimate and perfect Bible, don't look for a dry unconnected one, but go the source learn from God and his nation Israel.
