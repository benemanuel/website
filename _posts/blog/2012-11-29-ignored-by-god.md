[Ignored by God](http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2012/02/29/ignored-by-god/).

When God is related to as an inanimate object far from us, we can easily feel unrelated to him. Are we allowing the realization, that exists the spirit of God that lives within us? Do we prefer eating junk food, trash music, etc... and not willing to touch Gourmet food or listen to fine song, just from the fear that how will I live without it? Living without realization of God's spirit within×ª is life like a zombie. With it is no less then like breathing fresh air after being in a smoked filled room.

Spirit of God within me. You are the real me. You are the eternal "I". Spirit of God within me. Never allow my earthly part to forget you. Kick, pinch, punch him or do what ever you feel is right to keep it awake to you. Spirit of God within me. For you my earthly part was worthy of being created. For you I exist. As you I will return to God. Spirit of God within me. I wait patiently as I can that **we will become one**.
