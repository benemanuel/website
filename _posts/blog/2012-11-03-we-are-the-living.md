[We are the living](http://parolesdedieu.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/la-vie-apres-la-mort-existe/ "We are the living")

When I look at the stream of people running to work, walking to school, I can not help but think that we are the living dead, pretending to live.

Life is not about ones moving of his limbs and the using his brain, but to receive the gift of God, the birth of our soul.

We learn a lot of things, practical and intellectual, and philosophical, we believe that we are very wise and learned, but the truth is that wisdom lies elsewhere:

_The man who deviates from the path of wisdom, willÂ rest in the assembly of the dead \[Proverbs 21:16\]_

Stop for a moment to watch our vanity a race of our human efforts.

God, our Father loving, wants to take care of us, his children, and make us live in his womb.

Will - we will reach or refuse?
