Trapped within the confines of the laws, customs, and habits that you have personally established, you find yourself drowning.

This is the reality you've created. You feel compelled to partake in Gifilta Fish every Saturday, even if it feels like you're choking on it. Leaving the house without the obligatory red lipstick is inconceivable, locking you within your own home. You enforce rules that limit you from sitting next to a woman, resulting in standing awkwardly and leaving the seat vacant. Complaints about sore legs and water in your knees, just say to yourself. Passing judgments based on your whims, you shouldn't be taken aback when you find yourself condemned.

In simple terms, the rules fashioned by man become a burial ground, restricting him. On the other hand, the laws of God offer liberation.

Within the laws, customs and habits that you yourself have created, you drown.

Yes that's the way it is. You must have Gifilta Fish on Saturday, you're choking on it. Without the red lipstick you won't not leave the house, Be locked in your home. You create rules so you limiting yourself to sit next by a woman, so stand and leave the seat vacant, and complaints about sore legs, and knee your fill of water, you have only to yourself to complain. You judge according to your mood, judged you shall be it the same way, so don't be surprised when you came out guilty.

It's simple, rules created by man, burying him. Laws of God release him.
