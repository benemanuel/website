There are so many wisdoms out there in the world, so many people wanting to do things good, so many ancient traditions showing us how to do thing right.

That the time has come to put them all aside and be willing to put God a first in our life. Let Him and His words teach us. Be willing to allow Him to guide us.

For His wisdom is truth. His tradition is the most ancient. His doing is a creation of a wholeness of good and the only right.

(Isaiah 2,3 Micah 4,2)

And many  peoples\nations shall go and say: 'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

יש כל כך הרבה חכמות בעולם, כל כך הרבה אנשים הרוצים לעשות טוב, מסורות עתיקות רבות המלמדים אותנו הדרך לעשות טוב.

.הגיעה העת שנשים כולם בצד ושנהייה מוכנים לשם אלוהים ראשית בחיינו. לאפשר לו ודבריו ללומדינו

להיות מוכנים שהוא ידריך אותנו. כי חכמתו היא אמת ומסורתו עתיק ויצירתו שלימות הטוב והנכון

(ישעיה ב,ג  מיכה ד,ב )

 וְהָלְכוּ עַמִּים\גּוֹיִם רַבִּים וְאָמְרוּ לְכוּ וְנַעֲלֶה אֶל הַר יְהֹוָה אֶל בֵּית אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב וְיֹרֵנוּ מִדְּרָכָיו וְנֵלְכָה בְּאֹרְחֹתָיו כִּי מִצִּיּוֹן תֵּצֵא תוֹרָה וּדְבַר יְהֹוָה מִירוּשָׁלִָם:

  

An old Cherokee was teaching his grandson about life. "A fight is going on inside each one of us," he said to the boy. "It is a fight to the death, and it is between two wolves.  
"One is darkness -- he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.  
"The other is enlighted -- he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?" The old Cherokee simply replied, "The one you feed."  
  
this is Buddhist or American Indian but not from God.  
For God is not in the story and it contains the false dream that we can save ourselves from our egoistical self.
