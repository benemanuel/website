What a glutton I am.
Am I not full of personal pride, greed? Do I not have whims of wrath, envy & lust?
Do I not explain myself away freely as an excuse for my laziness, self-centeredness and general disinterest others (close and far)?

So while I am full of it, so does God when he cleans a purifies me has more room to add his spirit. For if I was a person of great virtues by nature, what can God clean of me?

Ezekiel tells us
The man said to me, “Son of man, watch closely, listen carefully, and pay attention to everything I show you, for you have been brought here so that I can show it to you. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.”(Ezekiel 40:4)
וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר אֵלַ֜י הָאִ֗ישׁ בֶּן־אָדָ֡ם רְאֵ֣ה בְעֵינֶיךָ֩ וּבְאָזְנֶ֨יךָ שְּׁמָ֜ע וְשִׂ֣ים לִבְּךָ֗ לְכֹ֤ל אֲשֶׁר־אֲנִי֙ מַרְאֶ֣ה אֹותָ֔ךְ כִּ֛י לְמַ֥עַן הַרְאֹֽותְכָ֖ה הֻבָ֣אתָה הֵ֑נָּה הַגֵּ֛ד אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה רֹאֶ֖ה לְבֵ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃(יחזקאל פרק מ פסוק ד)
He then tells us about the building of a great temple to God. Going into the measurements of each part. 

He said to me: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will live among the people of Israel forever. The house of Israel will no longer profane my holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their spiritual prostitution or by the pillars of their kings set up when they die. (Ezekiel 43:7)
וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗י בֶּן־אָדָם֙ אֶת־מְקֹ֣ום כִּסְאִ֗י וְאֶת־מְקֹום֙ כַּפֹּ֣ות רַגְלַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֧ר אֶשְׁכָּן־שָׁ֛ם בְּתֹ֥וךְ בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לְעֹולָ֑ם וְלֹ֣א יְטַמְּא֣וּ עֹ֣וד בֵּֽית־יִשְׂ֠רָאֵל שֵׁ֣ם קָדְשִׁ֞י הֵ֤מָּה וּמַלְכֵיהֶם֨ בִּזְנוּתָ֔ם וּבְפִגְרֵ֥י מַלְכֵיהֶ֖ם בָּֽמֹותָֽם׃(יחזקאל פרק מג פסוק ז)

### It's all for the purpose. Of God dwelling in with us always.

It's not that we are pure or perfect. The opposite is true. Only when we comprehend this and accept God and his purifying us can we have him truly live inside of us always.

קַדְּשׁוּ־צֹום֙ קִרְא֣וּ עֲצָרָ֔ה אִסְפ֣וּ זְקֵנִ֗ים כֹּ֚ל יֽשְׁבֵ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ בֵּ֖ית יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֑ם וְזַֽעֲק֖וּ אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה׃(יואל פרק א פסוק יד)
Announce a holy fast; proclaim a sacred assembly. Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land to the temple of the LORD your God, and cry out to the LORD.


וִֽיהוּדָ֖ה לְעֹולָ֣ם תֵּשֵׁ֑ב וִירֽוּשָׁלִַ֖ם לְדֹ֥ור וָדֹֽור׃ וְנִקֵּ֖יתִי דָּמָ֣ם לֹֽא־נִקֵּ֑יתִי וַֽיהֹוָ֖ה שֹׁכֵ֥ן בְּצִיֹּֽון׃ (יואל פרק ד פסוק כ-כא)
But Judah will reside securely forever,  
and Jerusalem will be secure from one generation to the next.  
I will avenge their blood that I had not previously acquitted.  
It is the Lord who dwells in Zion!

### The result of God showing himself to the world has catastrophic effects to what doesn't connect to him.

נָ֥חָה שָֽׁקְטָ֖ה כָּל־הָאָ֑רֶץ פָּֽצְח֖וּ רִנָּֽה׃(ישעיהו פרק יד פסוק ז)
The whole earth rests and is quiet; they break into song. (Isaiah 14:7)
