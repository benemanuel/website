I have a history of dreams with myself floating in the air. This morning again I was woken after such a dream.

Life is normal, I just can float about. The weight of gravity effects me as I please it to, or not.

Is it that I am completely free of the pressures of this world? No there here, but I am free to accept them or decide to ignore them.

When God is my rock of ages. My existence is totally dependent on him and nothing else. When walking into the furnace of fire is not what fears me, but the fear of walking into an existence which is godless.

Thank you God for you have shown and will continue to show me your path. Thank you God for giving me from your strength to choose you.

You must keep carefully all these commandments I am giving you today so that you may live, increase in number, and go in and occupy the land that the LORD promised to your ancestors.

כָּל־הַמִּצְוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָֽנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיֹּ֖ום תִּשְׁמְר֣וּן לַֽעֲשֹׂ֑ות לְמַ֨עַן תִּֽחְי֜וּן וּרְבִיתֶ֗ם וּבָאתֶם֙ וִֽירִשְׁתֶּ֣ם אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥ע יְהֺוָ֖ה לַֽאֲבֹֽתֵיכֶֽם׃(דברים פרק ח פסוק א)
