So you had an [awakening](woke-awakening-eye-opening-third-eye-enlightenment-spontaneous-spiritual-awakenings-ssa), you are starting to understand things different from what you did before.One of the first things you have to know is that this awakening was a present, gift, donation, benefaction, endowment and not payment nor achievement. **There is no difference between you and the other** except this gift. Use it carefully otherwise it will be taken away from you, at any time without your knowing it. You think you are fighting for some "Social Justice" but your ego gets stuck deep into it, and instead of doing good, as should the awakening do to you. You do evil as seen in this "Cancel Culture". You lose the awakening and become **worse then those who never were**.
