Go ask an AI to say something in the style of the Hebrew prophets. Overall not bad.

אָמַר־יְהוָה, מְעֹנֶה־בְּשַׁעֲרֵי־צִיּוֹן֙־עַתָּ֔ה יִשְׁבְּר֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י עָוֶ֑ן וְיָנֻ֖סוּ וְאֶת־הַנֶּפֶשׁ֙ לֹ֣א־יָנ֔וּסַ:

"Thus says the Lord: those who lament in the gates of Zion, now shall be broken; those who are drunk, but not with wine, shall flee."

Hmm... So those who are lamenting now will be punished for their lamenting, as they should be celebrating Zion. Those who just drunk and don't relate to what actually is, run away as they aren't connecting to reality.

And a blessing to the world.

בָּרֲכָ֥ה תְּבָרֲכֶ֖נָּה כָּל־הָאֻמּ֑וֹת יְשׁוּעַ֖ת־יְהוָ֥ה כָּתְתָֽה־עָלֵֽינוּ׃

"Blessed shall all the nations be; the salvation of the Lord has covered us."
