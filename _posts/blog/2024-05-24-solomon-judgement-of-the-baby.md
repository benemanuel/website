The **Judgement of Solomon** is a story in which Solomon ruled between two women who both claimed to be the mother of a child. Solomon ordered the baby be cut in half, with each woman to receive one half. The first woman accepted the compromise as fair, but the second begged Solomon to give the baby to her rival, preferring the baby to live, even without her. Solomon ordered the baby given to the second woman, as her love was selfless, as opposed to the first woman's selfish disregard for the baby's actual well-being.

[1 Kings 3:16â€“28] recounts that two mothers living in the same house, each the mother of an infant son, came to Solomon. One of the babies  had been smothered, and each claimed the remaining boy as her own. Calling for a sword, Solomon declared his judgment: the baby would be cut in two, each woman to receive half. One mother did not contest the ruling, declaring that if she could not have the baby then neither of them could, but the other begged Solomon, "Give the baby to her, just don't kill him!"

The king declared the second woman the true mother, as a mother would even give up her baby if that was necessary to save its life, and awarded her custody. This judgment became known throughout all of Israel and was considered an example of profound wisdom.


Israel chooses as the true mother in Solomon judgement of the baby, not to destroy the her true child, as to constantly search to reach peace and coexistence. The Arab world doesn't really care about the "Palestine" and just wants that the Jewish people not have it even at the cost if its complete destruction.

The core message is and remains relevant: prioritizing life, compassion, and understanding over conflict and destruction.
