<div dir="rtl">
הֲשִׁיבֵנוּ יְהוָה אֵלֶיךָ ונשוב \[וְנָשׁוּבָה\] חַדֵּשׁ יָמֵינוּ כְּקֶדֶם. איכה ה, כא </div>Restore us, God, to Thyself that we may return; renew our days as of old. As of when !? Not as we imagine, but what God originally created, pure and simple. Our hometown imagination is just from a nostalgic child's point-of-view. When we look as a adult, we must move on.
