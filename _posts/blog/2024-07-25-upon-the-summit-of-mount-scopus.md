**Upon the summit of Mount Scopus (in its original name: Jerusalem)**

From the top of the Mount of Scouts, I will bow down to you.
From the top of the Mount of Watchers, peace be upon you Jerusalem
For a hundred generations I dreamed of you,
To win to see in the light of your face.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, Shine your face on your son;
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, from your cities I will build you.

I came here with a confident heart, raise up your ruins
How then shall I build the house of your temple, if there is no peace between your builders?
Mizrachi, Ashkenazi, Yemenite, Ethiopian
Turkish and Georgian and ultra-Orthodox and Seculars
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, this is not what I saw in my dream!
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, peace be upon you!

A city of extravagance, you were my holy city;
Yet another closed gate is left in you, this is the gate of the Messiah.
Many of you have sent me messengers to you
Give me your keys.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, I swear in the name of my Lord:
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, Shine your face on your son!

From the top of the Mount of Watchers, peace to you Jerusalem;
Thousands of exiles from the ends of the earth, bearing their eyes to you.
with a thousand blessings be a blessing,
A king's temple, a royal city.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, I will not move from here;
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, the Messiah will come, he will come.
