**Upon the peak of Mount Scopus (in its original name: Jerusalem)**

From the peak of the Mount of Scouts/Watchers/Scopus, I will bow to you, my city.
From the peak of the Mount of Scouts/Watchers/Scopus, Peace/Greetings be upon you Yerushalayim.
For a hundred generations I dreamed of you,
To merit to see your light.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, Illuminate your face to your children!
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, From your ruins, I will build you!

With a trusting heart, I have come here, To raise your ruins. But how can I build your Temple If there is no peace among your children? 
Sephardim, Ashkenazim, Yemenites, Ethiopian,
Turkish and Georgian and Haredim and Seculars
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, this is not what I saw in my dream!
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, Â Among your children, grant peace!

City of desolation, you were a holy city,
Every gate shattered within you;
Yet one gate remains closed,
The gate of the Messiah.

Many of you have sent me messengers to you
To deliver into my hands your keys.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, I swear in the name of my Lord:
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, Shine your face on your son!

From the top of the Mount of Scouts/Watchers/Scopus, Peace/Greetings to you Jerusalem;
Thousands of exiles from the ends of the earth, Lift their eyes to you.
With thousands of blessings, be blessed,
A king's temple, a royal city.
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, I will not move from here;
Yerushalayim, Yerushalayim, the Messiah will come, he will come.

Avigdor Mayiri 1886
