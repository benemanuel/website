Ask not what God wants from you today, but ask what comfort zone you are stuck in today.

As I wrote in my last post [God-wants-requests-demands-pleads](god-wants-requests-demands-pleads). It all boils done to our willingness to listen, which is directly connected to to our being stuck in our comfort zone. We don't want to listen if it is uncomfortable for us, which leaves the omnipotent who is of patience and love, to help us listen in a more direct and usually uncomfortable fashion.

So let us pray so that we will accept what God is showing us in our being stuck in our comforts, so that we might start to hear what he really wants from us.
