It doesn't help while I have been run aground with a divorce where it seems that no problem that can pop up actually shows it's face.

Even though I am sure that I am right, even though the systems be them judicial, welfare just like others fail to see, or if they did see they fail to help bring out justice.

Despite all the pain and despair. I truly believe and pray that God and his justice will be actually seen. I understand that this might not be seen by me (even though I would enjoy that also).

I (try but don't always succeed) will do my utmost not to disturb this justice.

Even as thing start to look "normal" after four years of distress. New clouds know how to show up in the horizon. The blessing comes from Har Zion \* (pun intended)

I feel that in many situations we go thought, many hopes that someone, someplace will do something to "save the day".

The Savior is God and the trust and belief is only to him.

\*PSALMS **133,3** Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
