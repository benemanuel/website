And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter shall it be. And the LORD shall be King over all the earth; in that day shall the LORD be One, and His name one. (Zechariah 14,8-9)

The life with the total connection to God which gives pleasure and blissfulness to the entire world, even the dead sea gets life are a result from this connection and realization that God shows himself in the world in our life and lives within us. and for Him we live. Then "He and His name become one" God gives the world it the worldly pleasures to enjoy them. But he is a jealous God and that means that He must be put first, for him we must live and not for our pleasures.
