It is normally understood that when one fails, the responsibility of his failure is his own. Not so with Israeli politics. The government was elected using the tax payers monies for a four year period. They have failed getting their act together. Instead of paying for this failure, they put their hands into the taxpayers pocket. No remorse or apology. They demand it as part of "the proper democratic way"

Crooks have plenty of ways to explain their ways, as so do rapists. But the bottom line is still here. Crooks and rapists they are.

The people of Israel do NOT need your politics neither your warped democracy nor your illegitimate and unethical laws.

Deu 32:9 For the portion of the LORD is His people, Jacob the lot of His inheritance.
