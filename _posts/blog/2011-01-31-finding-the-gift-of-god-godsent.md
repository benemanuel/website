Well you can't. The best you can do is believe that God will actually send. Accustomed I am to think that when I put my head to something I will succeed. Well God showed me it work out the opposite. That for presents, the effort is not do give effort.

Otherwise it usually disturbs the nature of the way God gives us things. If you really, really want it. Then you will have to give it up.
