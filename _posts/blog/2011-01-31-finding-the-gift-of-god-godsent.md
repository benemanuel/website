It's not something you can actively find. The most you can do is believe that God will send it your way. I'm accustomed to thinking that if I set my mind to something, I'll succeed. However, God has shown me that, especially when it comes to gifts, the opposite is often true. Putting in effort doesn't necessarily bring about the desired result.

In fact, it tends to disrupt the natural way God provides for us. If you truly, deeply desire something, you may find that you have to let go of your efforts and surrender it to God in order to receive it.

Well you can't. The best you can do is believe that God will actually send. Accustomed I am to think that when I put my head to something I will succeed. Well God showed me it work out the opposite. That for presents, the effort is not do give effort.

Otherwise it usually disturbs the nature of the way God gives us things. If you really, really want it. Then you will have to give it up.
