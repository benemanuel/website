We all believe that everything will end well so whats the game? Indeed God makes salvation and puts us on the Sabbath. And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. (Genesis 1,31) Sabbath day which is that ends very well indeed. Where we are until then? Are we with him in His plans and actions as players or as guests on the side? Is the actor who has read the play and practiced his parts similar to the audience? Who felt fear when things happen? And who is quiet? Who is prepared for the next stanza who is not?
