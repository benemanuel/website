If the builders of the third temple would know that they would die before seeing it's dedication. Would they still be willing to build it ? 
This is a simple question with a simpler answer. They build it for God. They would like to see it's dedication. But for them the purpose in life is the building in it self and not the ultimate outcome. Even when they understand that they can not reach that point. The knowledge that some one, some day will and even more so that they helped that achievement gives them great consolidation.
Are we sad to look at our day of death ? If we put our life forwards toward the goal of being ONE with God, then we are happy. Even if that achievement was never really fully achieved during the life time. For the personal achievement to succeed so does the achievement of the nation of Israel and the World. For we are all intertwined as children of Adam and in the end THAT ACHIEVEMENT WILL BE FULFILLED. 
**That day God one and his name one.**
