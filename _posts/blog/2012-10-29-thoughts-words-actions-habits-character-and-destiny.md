Beware of your thoughts, they become your words. Beware of your words, they become your actions. Beware of your actions, they become your habits. Beware of your habits, they become your character. Beware of your character, it becomes your destiny.

Beware, be careful, watch out, One thing causes the next. "It becomes" you lose control and before you know it ... or Know that one thing has an ability to lead on to others to happen. Your responsibility demands you recognize this.

Beware/be careful not to forget God who is the only power to take you out of your egotistical self. **Allow him to guide you to your destiny.**
