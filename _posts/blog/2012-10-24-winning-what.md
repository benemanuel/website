A person finds it is easier to lose honorably then to win dishonorably.

The test of faith in justice and righteousness gets another round when the honor has been floored. It seems no longer a worthy cause. Its value depreciated by the ego.

The losing ones are walking away with there heads up. No shame nor remorse in their heart. When will God's judgment reach them? When will they learn his ways? Are they completely lost that they will have no opening of repentance?

God thank you for remembering your servant. Thank you for giving him what he really needs.

A ego free redemption.
