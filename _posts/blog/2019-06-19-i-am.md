Yesterday I was feeling down in the dumps. As I contemplated with my feeling I returned to that basic and simple comprehension that I am not what I feel nor am I what I think.

God when he revealed himself to Israel as a nation the first time did so as "I will be who I will be". God taught us in such a way how to connect to him and disconnect for our mortal selves.

We are who we are, when we see ourselves in God's eyes. We are not the sum of our feeling, thoughts, eating, actions, lusts etc. We are as God sees us.

Seeing yourself and others in God's eyes is demanding. It needs not to be disturbed by that part which isn't Godly.

The more practicing the better you get, the less feeling and thoughts which aren't helpful hang around.
