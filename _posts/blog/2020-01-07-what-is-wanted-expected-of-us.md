Not much, except this is everything.

God want us to accept and proclaim that he is God (the only God, with no other gods) and we are his creations.

This is what the LORD says:

"The heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool. Where then is the house you will build for me? Where is the place where I will rest? My hand made them; that is how they came to be," says the LORD.

I show special favor to the humble and contrite, who respect what I have to say.

We are expected to be that house/place/temple for God to reside.

We (all mankind, our nation, each and every one) are the sky pedestal.
