We are responsible for creating our own idols and then creating the rules/regulations/laws pertaining to their worship. Then we feel trapped in a manmade world of idols. But the way out is both simple and close by, whilst seemingly impossible. That is, accepting the truth of our situation. As soon as that is accepted, All the rules/regulations/laws will evaporate and cease to exist.

Even the very thought of maneuvering our way in and around these rules/regulations/laws is within itself a pitfall. For that thought itself gives some place/power back to the idols.

A simple litmus test that checks quickly and in a straightforward way whether something is idolatry or not is whether you can believe the truth yourself without using an intermediary. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say: 'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?' But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. Deuteronomy 30,12-14
