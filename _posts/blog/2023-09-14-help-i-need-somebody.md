Acknowledging that we need help and/or support and reaching out helps all. The alternative when we don't ask for it, is not only bad for us, but also for others.

Have we come to this world to be alone? Is not man a social being?
We have responsibilities not only to ourselves but to our parents, siblings, spouses and children and all of this is just the start.

As social beings connected to society at large we need to know how to ask and know how to give.
Does there exist one is perfect and has everything?
Does not everyone have something that can help the other?
Does not the other have something that can help me?

The harmony exists when each give and take. 
But the ego, distrust, fear and jealousy doesn't allow harmony to take place.

May we raise up to be as the angels of God and give and take as they do, in Gods spirit.
