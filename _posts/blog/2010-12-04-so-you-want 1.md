So u want  to .... ! Is that in you're nature ? Is it something u what/desire/urge for? If so then u know what is push/pulling u to it.but if not. It better be from a clean & pure place. For if it is not nature calling then clean  it must be. 

Note. U see your self pulled to something "not u" warning check at least twice.
