I want money, i want it a lot i want money,‏ ‏i want it somehow i want money, i want it a lot so give me, go give me some now

i want money, you have more than me i want money, so i can be free i want money, all for me can't you, can't you see

I want money, i want it a lot i want money, i want it somehow i want money, i want it a lot so give me, go give me some now

i want money, how did you see i want money, only for me i want money, and its not just that i want your love, thats my trap

I woke up this morning with this song in my head. So much it was stuck in my head that I was sure that I heard it somewhere. Well Google couldnt find any other source then mine. I welcome a band and singer to take this lyrics and maybe the tone that came with it.
