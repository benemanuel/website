We stop living. Living is having a free will and at death that no longer exists. From here on you can just be, no more choice and no more change. Your ability to rest-in-peace is completely dependent on your choices in life, as you will see what is happening in the world. One who made good choices will be at peace with their decisions and quiet with whatever the outcome is. Others who made bad ones will not be at peace. The term Heaven and Hell is used to describe this.
