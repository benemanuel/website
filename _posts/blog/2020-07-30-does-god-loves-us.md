That depends on what you call love.

If love is self-indulgence, then of course not.

Love is to be able to give, and God gives us all his love, but do we?

God gives us freedom, complete freedom.

In return we now can choose, freely good or evil.

Without God’s love we would not have this chance to choose.

One of the things we can hear when listening to music of the prophets is that bi-lateral love.

I will give two examples which a synagogue goer would be familiar.

1. The Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:23–27)
2. The Thirteen Attributes of Mercy (Exodus 34:6–7)

Both, in the melody which are used in the diaspora and still today in Israel are to a God who is of a tyrant nature and we plead mercy and beg for forgiveness or for blessing.

Nowhere in the chant or cry is there any element of a loving God and his forgiveness and natural blessing.

Following the original melody as described in “the music of the bible revealed” feel the love.
