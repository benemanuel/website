There is only one of the two tables. Where is the other? Which one of them are missing?

Is it possible to live with " I am the Lord thy God" and ignore "Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal."? Can you imagine us to be humanists and forget " Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image"?

The answer seems simple "Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord"

God gives us two tablets so that we remember who ordered "to be the person" otherwise we cannot be human. And that we remember that should "be a person", otherwise people consider themselves godly.

The people of Israel have a special place within the peoples of the world. The Eastern nations teach about the Ego and how a person should reach into himself to be a true human. The Western nations teach that there is a God in the world.

But only with Israel and the Torah that God revealed to His prophets gives weight to both the "forces" as one of the following. And nowhere is one without the other.

You cannot fix Ego without God. No connection to God without correction Ego.
