When I first arrived in Israel as a 16-year-old, the organization I came with failed to pick me up at the airport, leaving me to navigate a foreign country and language alone. Despite their later apology, I harbored no grudge; disorganization seemed par for the course.

My experiences shaped a mindset of expecting self-centered environments, prompting me to assert my needs clearly. Weeding an orchard recently, I pondered why some expect tasks to be one-time affairs. Just as meals require ongoing preparation, continual effort is essential. 

Dreams of streets paved with gold lead many to Jerusalem, akin to the American dream at Ellis Island. However, as one immigrant humorously noted, “I came to America because I heard the streets were paved with gold. When I got here, I found out three things: First, the streets weren’t paved with gold; second, they weren’t paved at all: and third, I was expected to pave them.”[[https://www.nationofimmigrators.com/in-memory/](https://www.nationofimmigrators.com/in-memory/)]. Opportunities exist, but hard work and personal responsibility is the key.

The hard work to:

- Fight and fight and fight - widowed, maimed, slaughtered, killed and become orphans.  then God gives peace to prevail throughout the land. (Leviticus 26:6 and others)
- Work and work and work - from pre sunrise to after sunset, blood, sweat, and tears.   By the sweat of your brow you will eat food ... (Genesis 3:19  New English Translation)
- Die and die and die - commit my life, strength and love to God. Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!  You must love the Lord your God with your whole mind, your whole being, and all your strength. (Deuteronomy 6:4-5 New English Translation)
- Accept my imperfection -  
    Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins. (Ecclesiastes 7:20)  
    Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.(Proverbs 3:5-6, NIV)  
    The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.(1 Samuel 16:7, NIV)
- And last but not least, complete trust in God, that he will show me the truth and always guide me. He and not some middle men. He gave and continues to give me all I really need. Then God said, “I now give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. (Gen 1:29)

These biblical verses underline the theme of persistent effort and commitment. Accepting imperfection, trusting in the Lord, and recognizing the importance of inner qualities. 

Lastly, embracing complete trust in God, bypassing intermediaries, as God's provision of essential sustenance.
