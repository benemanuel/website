Favorite flower: Cyclamen

Favorite Animal: Zebra

They both as a child I loved.

Cyclamen in my memories was beautiful lonely in the shadows among the stones.

Zebra was just like everyone else just another special one, not the simple colors of horses and donkeys.

What I have learned recently is that they are both found in herds or grow in clusters scattered many in the fields.

I see I'm not single, but there are others that they felt social isolation and felt their individuality.

Gather together and fill one with their friends as individuals together, but all are special, all are beautiful, there is no envy but the joy of togetherness. [![](assets/images/rakefot.jpg "rakefot")](http://aviwollman.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/rakefot.jpg)
