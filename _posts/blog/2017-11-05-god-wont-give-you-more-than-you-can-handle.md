God what do you have to say? Do you give us more then we can handle ?

He tore Israel away from David’s dynasty, and Jeroboam son of Nebat became their king.

Jeroboam drove Israel away from the Lord and encouraged them to commit a serious sin.

(2 Kings 17:21)

So you can't handle the fact that you sin, you get punished. you don't learn from your punishment and not only sin more but push others to sin. But God's to blame ????!!!!

These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt—Jacob and his sons:

Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob. . . . All the direct descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt with him were sixty-six in number. (This number does not include the wives of Jacob’s sons.) Counting the two sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, all the people of the household of Jacob who were in Egypt numbered seventy.

(Genesis 46:8-27)

God loves you and goes with you wherever you go (even to Egypt). He is their always to free you when you are ready.
