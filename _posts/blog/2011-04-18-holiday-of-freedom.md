What is freedom?

What is it to be free?

I see the multitude of options in front of me in my life, and on each day, etc.

I am ready and willing to do from one extreme to the other. in full dedication.

And only after I really felt I was ready to host all these possibilities,

The quiet inside me and gives me true freedom, if and how to.

That as long as I have a dependency on people, time, habit, etc. I am not free.

As long as my system automatically jumps up after comments of such, I'm not free.

Only I can say "I can" - "I can" eat pork, "I can" eat insects, "I can" eat chametz, "I can" steal, "I can" murder.

But ordered to me by God, really here and now, from divine revelation of his place within me, that place of silence "of a deafening silence" and then I'll know if and how to do.

And that liberty and freedom, and nothing in the world that can imprison and terrify and enslave this spirit, but humanity is not prepared to believe that God wants to reveal his will, and wants that we hear.

(10) And he said: 'I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.' (11) And He said: 'Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.' And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake; (12) and after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a deafening silence:_
