We are all plants in Gods garden, each one of us a different plant.

What we have in common is:

1. The need to grow up - reach out to the Sun
2. Then need to take root - to take the nourishment of God from out of the surroundings which we were born in.
3. We have to be willing to allow the Gardener to move us around in his garden as he wishes. Even if we think otherwise.
4. Each one is different so each one much make out there best to find what in there nature God created which they can glorify the life He gave us on earth in a matter which makes this life worth while. For I can not be someone else, but only myself.
