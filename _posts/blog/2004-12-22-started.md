After the first questions are no longer. As I've started as we can see

I have to finish the task of defining What it is that I've started.

The problem is that I'm not sure (yet). Something deep inside me

doesn't want to formalize the WHAT. Isn't it enought doing. Do we have

to define the what. Who cares WHAT or even who cares IF or WHY ? Isn't

it just enought doing ?
